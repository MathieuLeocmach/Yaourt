  Abstract                 = {From microbial biofilm communities to multicellular organisms, 3D macroscopic structures develop through poorly understood interplay between cellular processes and mechanical forces. Investigating wrinkled biofilms of Bacillus subtilis, we discovered a pattern of localized cell death that spatially focuses mechanical forces, and thereby initiates wrinkle formation. Deletion of genes implicated in biofilm development, together with mathematical modeling, revealed that ECM production underlies the localization of cell death. Simultaneously with cell death, we quantitatively measured mechanical stiffness and movement in WT and mutant biofilms. Results suggest that localized cell death provides an outlet for lateral compressive forces, thereby promoting vertical mechanical buckling, which subsequently leads to wrinkle formation. Guided by these findings, we were able to generate artificial wrinkle patterns within biofilms. Formation of 3D structures facilitated by cell death may underlie self-organization in other developmental systems, and could enable engineering of macroscopic structures from cell populations.},

  Abstract                 = {When calcium salts are added to an aqueous solution of polysaccharide pectin, ionic cross-links form between pectin chains, giving rise to a gel network in dilute solution. In this work, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is employed to study the microscopic dynamics of the fractal aggregates (flocs) that constitute the gels, while rheological measurements are performed to study the process of gel rupture. As calcium salt concentration is increased, DLS experiments reveal that the polydispersities of the flocs increase simultaneously with the characteristic relaxation times of the gel network. Above a critical salt concentration, the flocs become interlinked to form a reaction-limited fractal gel network. Rheological studies demonstrate that the limits of the linear rheological response and the critical stresses required to rupture these networks both decrease with increase in salt concentration. These features indicate that the ion-mediated pectin gels studied here lie in a `strong link' regime that is characterised by inter-floc links that are stronger than intra-floc links. A scaling analysis of the experimental data presented here demonstrates that the elasticities of the individual fractal flocs exhibit power-law dependences on the added salt concentration. We conclude that when pectin and salt concentrations are both increased, the number of fractal flocs of pectin increases simultaneously with the density of crosslinks, giving rise to very large values of the bulk elastic modulus.},

  Abstract                 = {An in-plane constrained cross-linked gel layer absorbs an equilibrium amount of solvent and experiences in-plane compressive stress. A stability analysis of such an elastic gel layer that is attached to either a viscous or an elastic bottom layer atop a rigid substrate is considered. The effects of the top and bottom layer moduli (E(t) and E(b)), the bottom-to-top layer thickness ratio (H/h), and the polymer solvent interaction parameter (chi) on the critical condition of wrinkling, wrinkle wavelength, and amplitude are examined. When the bottom layer is viscous, the compressed top layer is always unstable, and wrinkling is rate-controlled. The viscous flow of the bottom layer governs the rate and determines the fastest growing wavelength. As E(t) rises, the bending stiffness of the elastic layer does as well, and so the fastest growing wavelength (lambda(m)) rises and the equilibrium amplitude (A(e)) falls. As H/h rises, the constraint of the rigid substrate diminishes, and so lambda(m) and A(e) rise. As chi falls or as the solvent has higher affinity for the polymeric gel, lambda(m) falls and A(e) rises because better solvents create higher compressive strain that promote low-wavelength, high-amplitude wrinkles. When the bottom layer is elastic, a critical compressive stress exists. If the generated compressive stress by solvent absorption is greater than the critical stress, the top layer wrinkles. It was found that wrinkling is most likely at intermediate E(t), low E(b), high H/h, and low chi. Further, lower chi, higher H/h, and lower E(b) were found to promote higher equilibrium amplitude and higher wavelength wrinkles.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of the acidification rate and the final pH on the properties of sodium caseinate gels (2-6\%, w/v) prepared by acidification with glucono-$\delta$-lactone (GDL) at 10°C was investigated. The rheological properties of the systems were analysed under shear at incipient gelation and under uniaxial compression throughout the entire gelation process. The water holding capacity (WHC) of these gels and their amount of soluble protein in different media were also evaluated. Up to \~{}50\% of the total $\kappa$-casein content was soluble in gels with a higher amount of GDL, and this contributed to the high WHC observed under this condition. The acidification rate did not affect the rheological properties measured under shear during gelation, but the GDL/caseinate ratio used had a significant effect on the steady-state properties. Fast acidification resulted in lower Young's modulus and stress at fracture values, but higher residual stress values and relaxation times.

  Abstract                 = {Heating whey protein dispersions (90°C for 15 min) at low ionic strength and pH values far from isoelectric point (pH>6.5) induced the formation of soluble polymers. The effect of mineral environment during heating on the hydrodynamic characteristics and acid-induced gelation properties of polymers was studied. Whey protein dispersions (80g/l) were denatured at different pH (6.5–8.5) and calcium concentrations (0–4mm) according to a factorial design. At pH 6.5, the hydrodynamic radius of protein polymers increased with increasing calcium concentration, while the opposite trend was observed at pH 8.5. Intrinsic viscosity results suggested that heating conditions altered the shape of protein polymers. Whey protein polymers were acidified to pH 4.6 with glucono-$\delta$-lactone and formed opaque particulate gels. The storage modulus and firmness of gels were both affected by conditions used to prepare protein polymers. As a general trend, polymers with high intrinsic viscosity produced stronger gels, suggesting a relationship between polymer shape and gel strength. Acid gelation properties of whey protein polymers makes them suitable ingredients for yoghurt applications. Using whey protein polymers to standardize protein content increased yoghurt viscosity to 813Pa.s while using skim milk powder at same protein concentration increased yoghurt viscosity to 393Pa.s. Water holding capacity of protein polymers in yoghurt was 19.8ml/g compared to 7.2ml/g for skim milk powder protein. Acid gelation properties of whey protein polymers are modulated by calcium concentration and heating pH and offers new alternatives to control the texture of fermented dairy products.},

  Abstract                 = {A review is presented of a number of techniques available for the characterisation of the structure of aggregates formed from suspensions of sub-micron particles. Amongst the experimental techniques that have been commonly used are scattering (light, X-ray or neutron), settling and imaging and these are the focus of this work. The theoretical basis for the application of fractal geometry to characterisation of flocs and aggregates is followed by a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the above techniques. Of the scattering techniques available, light scattering provides the greatest potential for use as a tool for structure characterisation even though interpretation of the scattered intensity pattern is complicated by the strong interaction of light and matter. Restructuring further complicates the analysis. Although settling has long been used to characterise particle behaviour, the absence of an accurate permeability model limits the technique as a means of determining the porosity of fractal aggregates. However, it can be argued that the determination of fractal dimension is relatively unaffected. The strength of image analysis lies in its ability to provide a great deal of information about particle morphology and the weaknesses lie in the difficulties with image processing and sample size as this is a particle counting technique. There are very few papers which compare the fractal dimension measured by more than one technique. Light scattering potentially provides a useful tool for checking settling results. However, further work is required to develop proper models for aggregate permeability and flow-through effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Fruits and vegetables are usually composed of exocarp and sarcocarp and they take a variety of shapes when they are ripe. Buckled and wrinkled fruits and vegetables are often observed. This work aims at establishing the geometrical constraint for buckled and wrinkled shapes based on a mechanical model. The mismatch of expansion rate between the exocarp and sarcocarp can produce a compressive stress on the exocarp. We model a fruit/vegetable with exocarp and sarcocarp as a hyperelastic layer-substrate structure subjected to uniaxial compression. The derived bifurcation condition contains both geometrical and material constants. However, a careful analysis on this condition leads to the finding of a critical thickness ratio which separates the buckling and wrinkling modes, and remarkably, which is independent of the material stiffnesses. More specifically, it is found that if the thickness ratio is smaller than this critical value a fruit/vegetable should be in a buckling mode (under a sufficient stress); if a fruit/vegetable in a wrinkled shape the thickness ratio is always larger than this critical value. To verify the theoretical prediction, we consider four types of buckled fruits/vegetables and four types of wrinkled fruits/vegetables with three samples in each type. The geometrical parameters for the 24 samples are measured and it is found that indeed all the data fall into the theoretically predicted buckling or wrinkling domains. Some practical applications based on this critical thickness ratio are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The buckling and wrinkling of thin films has recently seen a surge of interest among physicists, biologists, mathematicians, and engineers. This activity has been triggered by the growing interest in developing technologies at ever-decreasing scales and the resulting necessity to control the mechanics of tiny structures, as well as by the realization that morphogenetic processes, such as the tissue-shaping instabilities occurring in animal epithelia or plant leaves, often emerge from mechanical instabilities of cell sheets. Although the most basic buckling instability of uniaxially compressed plates was understood by Euler more than two centuries ago, recent experiments on nanometrically thin (ultrathin) films have shown significant deviations from predictions of standard buckling theory. Motivated by this puzzle, we introduce here a theoretical model that allows for a systematic analysis of wrinkling in sheets far from their instability threshold. We focus on the simplest extension of Euler buckling that exhibits wrinkles of finite length--a sheet under axisymmetric tensile loads. The first study of this geometry, which is attributed to Lam\'{e}, allows us to construct a phase diagram that demonstrates the dramatic variation of wrinkling patterns from near-threshold to far-from-threshold conditions. Theoretical arguments and comparison to experiments show that the thinner the sheet is, the smaller is the compressive load above which the far-from-threshold regime emerges. This observation emphasizes the relevance of our analysis for nanomechanics applications.},

L'acidification par hydrolyse de Glucono-Delta-Lactone conduit \`{a} la g\'{e}lification du lait. Le suivi optique de ce processus (chapitre II) dans diverses conditions de temp\'{e}rature et de concentrations en GDL aboutit \`{a} la validation d'une m\'{e}thode turbidim\'{e}trie bas\'{e}e sur la r\'{e}flexion de la lumi\`{e}re. Le comportement des micelles de cas\'{e}ine durant l'acidification est \'{e}tudi\'{e} (chapitre III) gr\^{a}ce \`{a} diverses techniques collo\"{\i}dales telles la viscosim\'{e}trie capillaire, la granulom\'{e}trie laser ou la mobilit\'{e} \'{e}lectrophor\'{e}tique (potentiel z\'{e}ta). Confort\'{e}e par de nombreux travaux de la litt\'{e}rature, une repr\'{e}sentation sch\'{e}matique des m\'{e}canismes micellaires conduisant \`{a} la g\'{e}lification du lait est finalement propos\'{e}e. Ainsi la neutralisation des forces de r\'{e}pulsion \'{e}lectrostatiques des micelles provoquerait une contraction de l'enveloppe prot\'{e}ique et une fragilisation de leur structure interne. Soumises \`{a} l'agitation Brownienne, les collisions entre ces particules d\'{e}stabilis\'{e}es r\'{e}sulteraient en leur floculation. La formation d'agr\'{e}gats cas\'{e}iques est finalement (chapitre IV) trait\'{e}e selon la th\'{e}orie des fractals. Les valeurs de dimension fractale (D) obtenues par spectrophotom\'{e}trie sont en accord avec celles de la litt\'{e}rature. La d\'{e}pendance de D avec la temp\'{e}rature d'acidification mettrait en \'{e}vidence une structure plus compacte avec les basses temp\'{e}ratures},

  Abstract                 = {Stiff thin films on soft substrates are both ancient and commonplace in nature; for instance, animal skin comprises a stiff epidermis attached to a soft dermis. Although more recent and rare, artificial skins are increasingly used in a broad range of applications, including flexible electronics, tunable diffraction gratings, force spectroscopy in cells, modern metrology methods, and other devices. Here we show that model elastomeric artificial skins wrinkle in a hierarchical pattern consisting of self-similar buckles extending over five orders of magnitude in length scale, ranging from a few nanometres to a few millimetres. We provide a mechanism for the formation of this hierarchical wrinkling pattern, and quantify our experimental findings with both computations and a simple scaling theory. This allows us to harness the substrates for applications. In particular, we show how to use the multigeneration-wrinkled substrate for separating particles based on their size, while simultaneously forming linear chains of monodisperse particles.},

Such bodies exhibit residual stress when relaxed from all external constraints, and may assume complicated equilibrium shapes even in the absence of external forces. In this work we present a mathematical framework for such bodies in terms of a covariant theory of linear elasticity, valid for large displacements. We propose the concept of non-Euclidean plates to approximate many naturally formed thin elastic structures. We derive a thin plate theory, which is a generalization of existing linear plate theories, valid for large displacements but small strains, and arbitrary intrinsic geometry. We study a particular example of a hemispherical plate. We show the occurrence of a spontaneous buckling transition from a stretching dominated configuration to bending dominated configurations, under variation of the plate thickness.},

  Abstract                 = {The stress-induced yielding scenario of colloidal gels is investigated under rough boundary conditions by means of rheometry coupled to local velocity measurements. Under an applied shear stress, the fluidization of gels made of attractive carbon black particles suspended in a mineral oil is shown to involve a previously unreported shear rate response \$\backslash gp(t)\$ characterized by two well-defined and separated timescales \$\backslash tau\_c\$ and \$\backslash tau\_f\$. First \$\backslash gp(t)\$ decreases as a weak power law strongly reminiscent of the primary creep observed in numerous crystalline and amorphous solids, coined the "Andrade creep." We show that the bulk deformation remains homogeneous at the micron scale, which demonstrates that if plastic events take place or if any shear transformation zone exists, such phenomena occur at a smaller scale. As a key result of this paper, the duration \$\backslash tau\_c\$ of this creep regime decreases as a power law of the viscous stress, defined as the difference between the applied stress and the yield stress with an exponent ranging between 2 and 3 depending on the gel concentration. The end of this first regime is marked by a jump of the shear rate by several orders of magnitude, while the gel slowly slides as a solid block experiencing strong wall slip at both walls, despite rough boundary conditions. Finally, a second sudden increase of the shear rate is concomitant to the full fluidization of the material which ends up being homogeneously sheared. The corresponding fluidization time \$\backslash tau\_f\$ robustly follows an exponential decay with the applied shear stress as already reported for smooth boundary conditions. Finally, we highlight a few features that are common to attractive colloidal gels and to solid materials by discussing our results in the framework of theoretical approaches of solid rupture (kinetic, fiber bundle, and transient network models).},

  Abstract                 = {The flow properties of sodium caseinate (NaCAS) film-forming dispersions were studied as a function of protein and glycerol concentration. Apparent viscosity vs. concentration profiles showed a disruption at about 10\% (wt/wt) NaCAS. This was interpreted in terms of protein-water and protein-protein interactions. The presence of glycerol in the NaCAS film-forming suspensions reduced the viscosity of aqueous NaCAS as a consequence of decreasing protein-protein and protein-solvent interactions through the hydrogen bonding formation between the glycerol, the polypeptide chain of NaCAS, and water molecules. For higher concentration of glycerol, viscosity of NaCAS dispersions increased as a result of increasing total solid content. The glass transition temperature for solid films of 10\% (wt/wt) NaCAS decreased with the glycerol content. The glycerol-protein interactions reduced the protein-protein interaction and, thus, increased the intermolecular spacing, leading to higher protein chain mobility and water vapor permeability.},

  Abstract                 = {Surfaces with physicochemical properties that can be modulated using external stimuli offer great promise for designing responsive or adaptive materials. Here, we describe biocompatible dynamic scaffolds based on thin hydrogel coatings that reversibly hide and display surface chemical patterns in response to temperature changes. At room temperature, the gel absorbs water, triggering an elastic creasing instability that sequesters functionalized regions within tight folds in the surface. Deswelling at approximately 37 degrees C causes the gel surface to unfold, thereby regenerating the biomolecular patterns. Crease positions are directed by topographic features on the underlying substrate, and are translated into two-dimensional micrometre-scale surface chemical patterns through selective deposition of biochemically functionalized polyelectrolytes.

  Abstract                 = {Mechanical instabilities that cause periodic wrinkling during compression of layered materials find applications in stretchable electronics and microfabrication, but can also limit an application's performance owing to delamination or cracking under loading and surface inhomogeneities during swelling. In particular, because of curvature localization, finite deformations can cause wrinkles to evolve into folds. The wrinkle-to-fold transition has been documented in several systems, mostly under uniaxial stress. However, the nucleation, the spatial structure and the dynamics of the invasion of folds in two-dimensional stress configurations remain elusive. Here, using a two-layer polymeric system under biaxial compressive stress, we show that a repetitive wrinkle-to-fold transition generates a hierarchical network of folds during reorganization of the stress field. The folds delineate individual domains, and each domain subdivides into smaller ones over multiple generations. By modifying the boundary conditions and geometry, we demonstrate control over the final network morphology. The ideas introduced here should find application in the many situations where stress impacts two-dimensional pattern formation.},

  Abstract                 = {The adhesion dynamics of a membrane confined between two permeable walls is studied using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The membrane morphology decomposes into adhesion patches on the upper and the lower walls and obeys a nonlinear evolution equation that resembles that of phase separation dynamics, which is known to lead to coarsening, i.e. to the endless growth of the adhesion patches. However, due to the membrane bending rigidity the system evolves towards a frozen state without coarsening. This frozen state exhibits an order-disorder transition when increasing the permeability of the walls.},

  Abstract                 = {Biomaterials such as protein or polysaccharide gels are known to behave qualitatively as soft solids and to rupture under an external load. Combining optical and ultrasonic imaging to shear rheology we show that the failure scenario of a protein gel is typical of brittle solids: after a power-law creep regime fully accounted for by linear viscoelasticity and homogeneous deformation, fractures nucleate and grow logarithmically perpendicularly to shear up to sudden rupture. A single equation accounting for those two successive processes nicely captures the full rheological response. The failure time follows a decreasing power-law with the applied shear stress strongly reminiscent of the Basquin law of fatigue for solids. These results are in excellent agreement with recent fiber-bundle models that include damage accumulation on elastic fibers and exemplify protein gels as model brittle soft solids.},

The low-temperature G'-G'' crossover seen in temperature scans between 60 and 5 degrees C was thought to indicate gelation. Temperature scans from 5 to 90 degrees C revealed gradual decrease in G' followed by plateau values. In contrast, G'' decreased gradually and did not reach plateau values. Increase in hydrophobicity of the sodium caseinate or a decrease in the effective volume fraction of its aggregates may have contributed to these phenomena. The gelation and end of softening temperatures of the dispersions increased with the concentration of sodium caseinate. From an Eldridge-Ferry plot, the enthalpy of softening was estimated to be 29.6 kJ mol(-1). PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results of this study should be useful for creating new products with high concentrations of sodium caseinate.},

  Abstract                 = {When stretched uniaxially, a thin elastic sheet may exhibit buckling. The occurrence of buckling depends on the geometrical properties of the sheet and the magnitude of the applied strain. Here we show that an elastomeric sheet initially stable under uniaxial stretching can destabilize when exposed to a solvent that swells the elastomer. We demonstrate experimentally and computationally that the features of the buckling pattern depend on the magnitude of stretching, and this observation offers a new way for controlling the shape of a swollen homogeneous thin sheet.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soybean (Glycine max) is among the many legumes that are well known for 'hardseededness'. This feature can be beneficial for long-term seed survival, but is undesirable for the food processing industry. There is substantial disagreement concerning the mechanisms and related structures that control the permeability properties of soybean seed coats. In this work, the structural component that controls water entry into the seed is identified. METHODS: Six soybean cultivars were tested for their seed coat permeabilities to water. To identify the structural feature(s) that may contribute to the determination of these permeabilities, fluorescent tracer dyes, and light and electron microscopic techniques were used. KEY RESULTS: The cultivar 'Tachanagaha' has the most permeable seed coat, 'OX 951' the least permeable seed coat, and the permeabilities of the rest ('Harovinton', 'Williams', 'Clark L 67-3469', and 'Harosoy 63') are intermediate. All seeds have surface deposits, depressions, a light line, and a cuticle about 0.2 microm thick overlaying the palisade layer. In permeable cultivars the cuticle tends to break, whereas in impermeable seeds of 'OX 951' it remains intact. In the case of permeable seed coats, the majority of the cracks are from 1 to 5 micro m wide and from 20 to 200 micro m long, and occur more frequently on the dorsal side than in other regions of the seed coat, a position that correlates with the site of initial water uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The cuticle of the palisade layer is the key factor that determines the permeability property of a soybean seed coat. The cuticle of a permeable seed coat is mechanically weak and develops small cracks through which water can pass. The cuticle of an impermeable seed coat is mechanically strong and does not crack under normal circumstances.},

  Abstract                 = {The distinctive properties of graphene sheets may be significantly influenced by the presence of corrugation structures. Our understanding of these graphene structures has been limited to the mesoscopic scale. Here we characterize angstrom-scale periodic buckling structures in free-standing graphene bilayers produced by liquid-phase processing in the absence of specific substrates. Monochromated, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy with sub-angstrom resolution revealed that the unit structures in the major buckling direction consist of only two and three unit cells of graphene's honeycomb lattice, resulting in buckling wavelengths of 3.6 ± 0.5 and 6.4 ± 0.8 \AA, respectively. The buckling shows a strong preference of chiral direction and spontaneously chooses the orientation of the lowest deformation energy, governed by simple geometry rules agreeing with Euler buckling theory. Unexpectedly, the overall buckled structures demonstrate geometric complexity with cascaded features. First-principles calculations suggest that significant anisotropic changes in the electronic structure of graphene are induced by the buckling.},

Because foodstuffs are governed by the rules of SCM physics but with all the complications related to real systems, the experimental and theoretical approaches of SCM physics have deepened our comprehension of their nature and behaviour, but many questions remain. In this review we discuss the current understanding of food science, by considering established SCM methods as well as emerging techniques and theoretical approaches. With their complexity, heterogeneity and multitude of states, foods provide SCM physics with a challenge of remarkable importance.},

The Brownian diffusion of fluorescent microspheres (0.21, 0.32, 0.5, and 0.89$\mu$m in diameter) with different surface coatings (polyethylene glycol, carboxylate groups and polystyrene) was used to probe spatial mechanical properties of the gels at the scale of microns. The microrheological results are compared with the macroscopic viscoelastic properties (storage and loss shear modulus) measured in a concentric cylinder rheometer (double gap, at shear strain of 0.005 and frequency of 1Hz). At pH values close to pI of the caseins, where formation of a protein network, i.e., gelation, became obvious from the confocal microscopy and bulk rheological measurements, all the particles had a tendency to adhere to the network. In spite of this, the microrheological values of the moduli were only slightly lower than the macroscopically determined values and the gel points calculated via both techniques tended to be in good agreement. However, the particle tracking method has higher sensitivity and can detect changes in the structuring of the system before these are registered by the bulk rheological measurement.},

  Abstract                 = {A preordered microwrinkle pattern on a metal-capped surface of a soft elastomer is employed to elucidate the elementary buckling phenomenon during strain-induced stripe rearrangement processes. The preordered one-dimensional stripe tends to align perpendicular to the direction of strain reversibly when lateral compressive strain is applied on the substrate at some angle phi with respect to the stripe orientation. For any value of strain, the film surface can be decomposed in domains containing stripes with two different orientations, namely the original and applied strain orientations. As strain is increased, the domains of the second type of stripes progressively grow and invade the whole surface. Interestingly, the domain shapes during growth are composed of parallelogram units that simply depend on phi and stripe wavelength. Moreover, domain growth proceeds in characteristic directions depending on the shape of the domain unit.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-linear mechanical behavior at large shear deformation was been investigated for heat-set beta-lactoglobulin gels at pH 7 and 0.1 M NaCl using both oscillatory shear and shear flow. These gels have a self-similar structure at length scales smaller than the correlation length of the gel with fractal dimension d(f)=2. Strain hardening is observed that can be well described using the model proposed by Gisler et al. [T.C. Gisler, R.C. Ball, D.A. Weitz, Phys. Rev. Let. 82 (1999) 1064] for fractal colloidal gels. The increase of the shear modulus normalized by the low strain value (G(0)) is independent of G(0). For weak gels the elasticity increases up to a factor of ten, while for strong gels the increase is very small. At higher deformation irreversible fracture occurs, which leads eventually to macroscopic failure of the gel. For weak gels formed at low concentrations the deformation at failure is about 2, independent of the shear modulus. For strong gels fracture occurs at approximately constant stress (2 x 10(3) Pa).},

  Abstract                 = {The general aim of the work described in this thesis was to investigate structure-rheology relations for dairy related products, focusing on model systems containing sodium caseinate. The acid induced gelation of sodium caseinate, of sodium caseinate stabilized emulsions, and the effect of shear on the structure formation was characterized. Special attention was given to the sol-gel transition point, which was defined by a frequency independent loss tangent. It was shown that the sol-gel transition point is completely controlled by the pH and the temperature, independent of the concentration sodium caseinate or the applied shear rate. Considering sodium caseinate solutions, increase of the temperature of acidification caused a decrease of the critical pH for gelation and a more dense gel structure. The formed gels were not in thermodynamic equilibrium, however, due to the slow kinetics of the system they were stable on the time scale of the experiment. At the gel point we have strong indications that the structure can not be characterized by a single fractal dimension. During the acid induced gelation of sodium caseinate stabilized emulsions a single sol-gel transition was observed. Addition of an excess of sodium caseinate to the emulsion resulted in two sol-gel transitions upon acidification. Application of shear during the acidification of the emulsions showed a decreasing radius of the aggregates formed at the gelpoint with increasing shear rate. The aggregates formed became more dense due to the application of shear while the network that was formed by the aggregates became less compact. No shear induced alignment was observed of emulsion droplets dispersed in water or in a sodium caseinate solution, while emulsion droplets dispersed in a xanthan solution did align in a shear field. Addition of sodium inhibited the string formation of the emulsion droplets},

  Abstract                 = {The developing vertebrate gut tube forms a reproducible looped pattern as it grows into the body cavity. Here we use developmental experiments to eliminate alternative models and show that gut looping morphogenesis is driven by the homogeneous and isotropic forces that arise from the relative growth between the gut tube and the anchoring dorsal mesenteric sheet, tissues that grow at different rates. A simple physical mimic, using a differentially strained composite of a pliable rubber tube and a soft latex sheet is consistent with this mechanism and produces similar patterns. We devise a mathematical theory and a computational model for the number, size and shape of intestinal loops based solely on the measurable geometry, elasticity and relative growth of the tissues. The predictions of our theory are quantitatively consistent with observations of intestinal loops at different stages of development in the chick embryo. Our model also accounts for the qualitative and quantitative variation in the distinct gut looping patterns seen in a variety of species including quail, finch and mouse, illuminating how the simple macroscopic mechanics of differential growth drives the morphology of the developing gut.},

We find that these steps of villification depend on the sequential differentiation of the distinct smooth muscle layers of the gut, which restrict the expansion of the growing endoderm and mesenchyme, generating compressive stresses that lead to their buckling and folding. A quantitative computational model, incorporating measured properties of the developing gut, recapitulates the morphological patterns seen during villification in a variety of species. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the formation of these elaborations of the lining of the gut, essential for providing sufficient surface area for nutrient absorption.},

  Abstract                 = {The fractal dimension of a particle aggregate can provide fundamental information on the structure and origin of the aggregate. The analysis of large chemically homogeneous fractal objects has been achieved, but reliable methods of estimating the fractal dimensions of large and chemically heterogeneous aggregates are needed. To this end, we used confocal scanning laser microscopy in which thin optical sections of aggregates were obtained in order to calculate their 2D and ultimately 3D fractal dimensions according to the Mandelbrot theory. Fractal dimensions of 2.08 +/- 0.11 for a Brownian aggregation of latex particles and 2.25 +/- 0.12 for shear aggregation were determined using the confocal technique. These values are within the ranges for universality classes predicted for such aggregates and observed by previous investigators. Thus, this method appears to provide reliable estimates of the fractal dimension with particular utility in the characterization of aggregates composed of larger particles or complex materials where the fractal dimension may not be accessible by light-scattering measurements. The confocal method is used to analyze flocs of activated sludge material as one example of the application of this method to more complex, large (up to 500 µm), and chemically heterogeneous flocs.

  Abstract                 = {Wrinkled morphology is a distinctive phenotype observed in mature biofilms produced by a great number of bacteria. Here we study the formation of macroscopic structures (wrinkles and folds) observed during the maturation of Bacillus subtilis pellicles in relation to their mechanical response. We show how the mechanical buckling instability can explain their formation. By performing simple tests, we highlight the role of confining geometry and growth in determining the symmetry of wrinkles. We also experimentally demonstrate that the pellicles are soft elastic materials for small deformations induced by a tensile device. The wrinkled structures are then described by using the equations of elastic plates, which include the growth process as a simple parameter representing biomass production. This growth controls buckling instability, which triggers the formation of wrinkles. We also describe how the structure of ripples is modified when capillary effects are dominant. Finally, the experiments performed on a mutant strain indicate that the presence of an extracellular matrix is required to maintain a connective and elastic pellicle.},

  Abstract                 = {Casein gels are found in hard and soft dairy foods such as cheese and yogurt, and their rheological properties can be analyzed with various instrumental techniques. Empirical tests of cheese have been used since cheese making began, and imitative tests have been conducted in laboratories since the 1930s. Texture profile analysis is now the most frequently used imitative test. Fundamental tests provide a better representation of cheese and yogurt rheology because of the systematic mathematical treatment involved. Uniaxial compression and stress and strain relaxation tests are among the fundamental tests performed on cheese, and viscosity data are often used to investigate the physical characteristics of yogurt. Small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements are applicable to both products. Food scientists can acquire a clearer picture of the structure of dairy foods by performing appropriate rheological studies of the casein matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {The wrinkling and delamination of stiff thin films adhered to a polymer substrate have important applications in "flexible electronics." The resulting periodic structures, when used for circuitry, have remarkable mechanical properties because stretching or twisting of the substrate is mostly accommodated through bending of the film, which minimizes fatigue or fracture. To date, applications in this context have used substrate patterning to create an anisotropic substrate-film adhesion energy, thereby producing a controlled array of delamination "blisters." However, even in the absence of such patterning, blisters appear spontaneously, with a characteristic size. Here, we perform well-controlled experiments at macroscopic scales to study what sets the dimensions of these blisters in terms of the material properties and explain our results by using a combination of scaling and analytical methods. Besides pointing to a method for determining the interfacial toughness, our analysis suggests a number of design guidelines for the thin films used in flexible electronic applications. Crucially, we show that, to avoid the possibility that delamination may cause fatigue damage, the thin film thickness must be greater than a critical value, which we determine.},

Starting from a damage-accumulation function proportional to (Deltasigma)(gamma), Deltasigma being the stress amplitude, we show analytically that the asymptotic exponent m can be expressed as a piecewise-linear function of the exponent gamma, namely, m=6-2gamma for gamma<gamma(c), and m=gamma for gamma> or =gamma(c), reflecting the existence of a critical value gamma(c)=2. We perform numerical simulations to confirm this result for finite sizes. Finally, we introduce bounded disorder in the breaking thresholds and find that below gamma(c) disorder is relevant, i.e., the exponent m is changed, while above gamma(c) disorder is irrelevant.},

  Abstract                 = {A review in which many original published results of the authors as well as many other papers are discussed. The structure and some properties of the globular proteins are shortly presented, special accent being put on the alpha-chymotrypsin (alpha-ChT), lysozyme (LZ), human serum albumin (HSA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) which have been used in the experiments with thin liquid films. The behaviour of protein adsorption layers (PAL) is extensively discussed. The dynamics of PAL formation, including the kinetics of adsorption as well as the time evolution of the surface tension of protein aqueous solutions, are considered. A considerable place is devoted to the surface tension and adsorption isotherms of the globular protein solutions, the simulation of PAL by interacting hard spheres, the experimental surface tension isotherms of the above mentioned proteins, and the interfacial tension isotherms for the protein aqueous solution/oil interface. The rheological properties of PAL at fluid interfaces are shortly reviewed. After a brief information about the experimental methods for investigation of protein thin liquid (foam or emulsion) films, the properties of the protein black foam films are extensively discussed: the conditions for their formation, the influence of the electrolytes and pH on the film type and stability, the thermodynamic properties of the black foam films, the contact angles film/bulk and their dynamic hysteresis. The next center of attention concerns some properties of the protein emulsion films: the conditions for formation of emulsion black films, the formation and development of a dimpling in microscopic, circular films. The protein-phospholipid mixed foam films are also briefly considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Fingertips often wrinkle after extended exposure to water. The underlying mechanics issues, in particular the critical parameters governing the wrinkled morphology, are studied by using both finite element simulation and analytical modeling. The wrinkling behaviors, characterized by the wrinkle-to-wrinkle distance (wavelength), wrinkle depth (amplitude) and critical wrinkling stress/strain, are investigated as the geometry and material parameters of the fingertip are varied. A simple reduced model is employed to understand the effect of finger curvature and skin thickness, whereas a more refined full anatomical model provides the basis for analyzing the effect of a multilayered skin structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the stiffness of the stratum corneum and the dermal layer in the skin has a large effect on the wrinkling behavior, which agrees well with the analytical predictions. From the uncovered mechanical principles, potential ways for effectively slowing down and suppressing skin wrinkles are proposed; among them, increasing the modulus of the dermal layer in the skin appears to be the most effective.},
