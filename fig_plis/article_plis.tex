\maketitle

In the present work, we study the swelling-induced wrinkling of a porous gel sheet sandwiched between two viscous layers, with the whole system confined between two glass plates. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics}, the lateral confinement leads to saturation of the amplitude on the floor and ceiling followed by a cascade of secondary, ternary, etc. buckling. Such cascade buckling have been observed by~\cite{Roman1999} in a one dimensional macroscopic system, a sheet of steel forced to buckle. The 2D nature of our experiment creates nested patterns that could prove useful to design optical elements. In addition, one has to note that the primary wavelength is much smaller than the size of the system, implying that we are not in a simple buckling scenario but in a wrinkling instability. Our main result is to identify this selection mechanism.


In the following, we will describe the physical chemistry that allows us to form such patterns. Then, we will model the situation and identify two possible selection mechanisms: either Darcy flow or Poiseuille flow. Finally we will compare our experimental data with the two models. Combining both Darcy and Poiseuille mechanisms will allow us to describe our data.


The slow acidification of a protein (sodium caseinate) solution up to the isoelectric pH induces gelation. Since caseins adsorb strongly to interfaces, the resulting gel sticks strongly to container walls, allowing rheological measurements. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification}, further decrease of the pH beyond the isoeletric point weakens the gel. This non monotonous behaviour of the elastic modulus translates in a non monotonous mesh size in a microscopy cell (slit geometry) coated so that the casein could not adsorb on the top wall (Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification}c), i.e. in syn\ae{}resis (solvent expulsion) followed by swelling.


Figure~\ref{fig:sideview}b shows confocal measurements in the case where both top and bottom walls have been coated. Starting from an homogeneous solution (black margins correspond to the glass walls), the gel forms and simultaneously expels solvent on both sides. Since we have two clear interfaces between a protein rich phase and a protein poor (water) phase, we model the resulting situation as a porous elastic sheet of thickness $h$ sandwiched between two viscous layers of respective thicknesses $H_1$ et $H_2$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}a). Relative increase in protein concentration during syn\ae{}resis can be deduced from the brighter fluorescence in second panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}b. Extracting the top and bottom surface of the gel phase allows for quantitative measurements of the relative volume (Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}c) and excess surface area of the sheet of gel (Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}d). We can thus confirm that the instability is due to swelling.

Note that adhesion to side walls is necessary to prevent total syn\ae{}resis and thus allow subsequent planar stresses while swelling. Also, the only situation were be observed wrinkling is when both top and bottom walls are coated. We confirmed that at any given time the thickness $h$ of the sheet of gel is homogeneous in $(x,y)$. The contrast in transmission microscopy (Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics}a) is not due to thickness inhomogeneities but to altitude gradients. The length of the optical path (along $z$) through the gel phase is larger where the gel makes a slope compared to a flat situation, as indicated by the yellow vertical lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}a.

\section*{Scalings}

The characteristic length $\lambda^*$ of a wrinkling pattern is set by the competition between the flexural modulus of the sheet $B=E/(1-\nu^2)$ ($E$ Young modulus, $\nu$ Poisson ratio) and a lateral load $q$~\cite{Vella2009,Kolinski2009}: 
\begin{equation}
\lambda^* \sim h \left(\frac{B}{q}\right)^{1/3}.
\label{eq:lstar}
\end{equation}
In small deflection actual wavelength $\lambda$ is related to the amplitude $A$ as $\lambda \sim A^{1/4} \lambda^{*3/4}$.

We identify three possible candidates for the lateral load $q$: the weight or buoyancy of the gel, the porous flow through the gel or the viscous flows in the surrounding water layers. We confirmed that the former was playing no role by successfully repeating our experiment in a cell held vertical, i.e. with the weight acting longitudinally rather than laterally.

In a situation where the sheet of gel would be sitting (not sticking) to the floor of the cell ($H_1\rightarrow0$), creating a 2D blister requires flowing solvent of viscosity $\eta$ through the gel of permeability $\alpha$. Darcy law relates the gradient of pressure (identified to $q/h$) to the volume flux per unit area $v = \frac{\alpha}{\eta}\frac{q}{h} = \frac{dA}{dt}$. Injecting this expression in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lstar}) yields the wavelength of the Darcy mode as
\begin{equation}
\lambda_D \sim h^{1/2} \alpha^{1/4} \Upsilon^{1/4}
\end{equation}
where $\Upsilon = B\tau/\eta$ is a dimensionless viscoelastic factor quantifying the relative stiffness of the sheet and the solvent at a characteristic time $\tau$. This expression stresses the kinetic nature of the wavelength selection. However we note that the wavelength of the primary pattern does not evolve with time (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics} and Sup. Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}) once the gel is touching both walls, we can deduce the relevant $\tau$ from the growth of the primary pattern (see Supplementary Method for the precise definition).

Conversely, in a situation where the sheet of gel would be impervious ($\alpha\rightarrow 0$), destabilisation over a wavelength $\lambda$ would create a lubrication ($H\ll\lambda$) flow in the viscous layers. The longitudinal flux $Q$ is related to the longitudinal pressure gradient $q/\lambda$ by a Poiseuille flow expression $Q = \frac{H^3}{12\eta} \frac{q}{\lambda}$. Mass conservation relates



\section*{Methods summary}
To prevent adsorption of caseins to surfaces, microscope slides and cover-slips were cleaned and subsequently coated with a silane agent (3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, Sigma Aldrich) to which a polyacrylamide brush was polymerized from methacrylate groups.
Sodium caseinate (Firmenich) was labelled with Dylight~550 NHS ESTER (Thermo Scientific) and then purified by centrifugation. Unlabelled sodium caseinate powder was dissolved in deionised water (or water+glycerol mixture). To induce gelation glucono-$\delta$-lactone (GDL) in powder (Firmenich) was added to the solution. \SI{45}{\micro\litre} of this solution was immediately mixed with \SI{5}{\micro\litre} of labelled caseinate solution and injected in the microscopy cell, immediately sealed using ultraviolet-cured glue (Norland Optical) and placed under the microscope before gelation could take place. 
3D data were collected on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, using \SI{532}{\nano\meter} laser excitation. We used either 10x (air) lens to measure the geometry of wrinkling (see SM) or 63x (oil) lens to observe the microstructure of the gel. Larger scope pictures, obtained either by stitching fluorescent microscope data or by transmitted/reflected light macroscope (Nikkon SMZ745T/Leica DMS1000), were used to measure the wavelength of the primary pattern. Secondary pattern wavelength is set to half of the primary wavelength, according to Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics}c.
Data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification} a-b were obtained with a SevenCompact pH-meter (Mettler Toledo) and an MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar).

\subsection*{Microstructure measurement}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{mesh}
	\caption{Gel microstructure. (a) Detail of a confocal micrograph of a 4\%w casein, 4\%w GDL in water, when only the slide is coated (not the cover slip). Time corresponds to the minimum in mesh size. Scale bar is \SI{10}{\micro\metre}. (b) Corresponding radial averaged Fourier transform. Black line is the best fit by Eq.XXX with $\xi=\SI{4.9}{\micro\metre}$ and $\gamma=2.4$. Inset shows the center of the non radial average spectrum (arbitrary logarithmic color scale).

	\label{fig:mesh}
\end{figure}

To follow the evolution of the microstructure in a gel undergoing syn\ae{}resis and swelling, we had to keep it in the thin focal plane of the 63x objective lens of the confocal microscope. To do so, we coated only the microscope slide with acrylamide brush to allow syn\ae{}resis on this side. The cover-slip was cleaned but not coated, thus keeping strong adhesion on the side closer to the objective lens. Neither buckling nor wrinkling was detected in such configuration.

We acquired slices of $(\SI{2048}{px})^2$ with pixels of \SI{98}{\nano\metre} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:mesh}a and c). After Hann windowing we performed Fourier transform (see insets of Fig.~\ref{fig:mesh}b and d) and radially averaged the resulting spectrum to obtain $I(q)$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:mesh}b and d) that we fit by the following fractal form:
\begin{equation}
I(q) = \frac{\chi}{1+(\xi q)^\gamma}
\end{equation}
were the susceptibility $\chi$ is related to the contrast of fluorescence between the network and the solvent, the cut off length $\xi$ corresponds to the largest pore size and the exponent $\gamma$ is loosely related to the fractal dimension. 

\subsection*{Permeability measurements}
\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics{permeability}
	\caption{Permeability measurements. (a) Schematic representation of the experiment. (b-c) Evolution of the height of the interface in tube 1 relative to the final height in tube 2.

(c) Idem in 50\%w glycerol, $H=\SI{4}{\milli\metre}$ and $\tau=\SI{100}{\hour}$.}
	\label{fig:permeability}
\end{figure*}

To measure the permeability of our gels, we adapt a method from \cite{VanDijk1986}. First, the gel of interest is formed at the lower extremity of a thin glass tube. The tube is held vertical in a water saturated atmosphere to prevent evaporation until the pH has reached the isoelectric point ($\approx\SI{1}{\hour}$ for our most common composition). Then, we dip the tube in a bath of acetic acid/acetate buffer at pH=4. The buffer has the same glycerol content as the gel solvent, so that the viscosity is constant throughout the experiment. Alongside the first tube (see Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability} a), we dip a second identical tube with no gel in it. A webcam (Logitech Webcam Pro 9000) records the rise of the liquid in each tube. Since the liquid height in tube 2 reaches its final value quickly, we measure directly $z_\infty-z(t)$.

Darcy law through the gel of permeability $\alpha$ and height $H$ writes
\begin{equation}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\alpha}{\eta}\frac{\Delta P}{H}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta P$ is the the hydrostatic pressure relative to $z_\infty$. We can thus write
\begin{equation}
\frac{d(z_\infty-z)}{dt} = -\frac{z_\infty-z}{\tau}\text{, with\,} \tau = \frac{\eta H}{\alpha \rho g}.
\end{equation}

By fitting $z_\infty-z(t)$ by an exponential (see Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability} b-c), we obtain $\tau$ and thus $\alpha$. Note that even with $H$ of the order of a few millimetres high glycerol contents yield $\tau\approx \SI{100}{\hour}$ due both to high viscosities and low permeability. Obtaining $z_\infty$ without tube 2 would be time prohibitive.

\subsection*{Confocal images segmentation}

At 10x magnification, we acquired sacks of (depending on cell thickness) 20 to 50 images spaced by \SI{6.69}{\micro\metre} (Nyquist sampling). Each confocal slice was $(\SI{256}{px})^2$ with pixels of \SI{4.97}{\micro\metre}. At this low resolution details of the gel microstructure are undistinguishable ($\xi<$px for all compositions) and the gel appear as a continuous medium.

We first denoise each plane by a small Gaussian blur ($\sigma=\SI{2}{px}\ll\lambda$). Then, for each $(x,y)$, we focus on the z-dependant intensity profile $I(z)$. We define the position of the top surface of the gel $z_\text{top}$ as where $I(z)$ first crosses half of its maximum value. Since the criterion is local, we do not need to correct for background intensity variation. In this way we obtain $z_\text{top}(x,y)$ with subpixel resolution ($\pm\SI{0.1}{px}=\SI{0.67}{\micro\metre}$), and $z_\text{bottom}(x,y)$ in a symmetrical way.

From these data, we obtain for each stack the volume and thickness of the gel phase, area of the midsurface and peak-to-peak amplitude. Velocity is obtained by time differentiation. Once the instability has saturated on floor and ceiling of the cell, peaks in the histograms of $z_\text{top}$, and $z_\text{bottom}$ yield the measure of the positions of the walls, thus to $e$ and retrospectively to $H_1$ and $H_2$.

\subsection*{Characteristic time measurement}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{growth}
	\caption{Growth of the instability. (a) Evolution of the gel velocity $v$, integrated over the whole surface. Inset: Evolution of the amplitude (peak to peak measurement) in semi logarithmic scale. Black line is the best exponential fit with $\tau=\SI{90}{\second}$. (b) Evolution of the bottom profile of the gel from the onset of instability (yellow) to the contact to both walls (brown). Note that the lateral size of the blister evolve in this regime. Thick black curve is the profile at much longer time. Note that blister foot (highlighted by the orange vertical line) has not moved since contact.}
	\label{fig:growth}
\end{figure}

In most of our samples, it was possible to measure directly the peak-to-peak amplitude $A(t)$ from our confocal measurements. However when the wavelength is too large compared to the field of view, this approach breaks down since we cannot observe both highest and lowest point of the surface. Even when valid, such local measurement is noisy and we prefer the measure of the vertical displacement of the gel $v$ that can be integrated over the whole field of view.

We note that when both measurements were available (as in Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}a), the characteristic time $\tau$ obtained from the fit of the exponential growth of $A(t)$ was about $4A_\text{max}/v_\text{max}$, where $A_\text{max} = e-h$ is the amplitude when the gel comes in contact with both walls. We thus used consistently this approximation of $\tau$ for all our samples. This is coherent with the fact that the blister size $\propto\lambda$ does not evolve after contact (see Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}b), thus the kinetic wavelength is decided when $A(t) = A_\text{max}$.

\subsection*{Darcy+Poiseuille model}

Mechanical equilibrium of a plate of thickness $h$, young modulus $E$ and Poisson ratio $\nu$ submitted to a compression load $\sigma_0$ along $x$ and a lateral load $q$ along $z$ writes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E h^3}{12(1-\nu^2)}\frac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} + \sigma_0 h \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} = q,
\label{eq:mecheq}
\end{equation}
where $w(x,t)$ is the deflection of the plate along $z$.

We suppose an exponentially growing sinusoidal deflection $w(x,t) =  A_0 e^{t/\tau} \sin kx$ of characteristic time $\tau$ and wavevector $k$. In operator language, Eq.~\ref{eq:mecheq} writes:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{1}{12} B h^3 k^4 - \sigma_0 h k^2\right)w = q,
\label{eq:mecheqop}
\end{equation}
where $B=E/(1-\nu^2)$ is the modulus of the plate.

\subsubsection*{Elastic film in an infinite elastic medium}

The deformation of the substrate of modulus $B_s$ gives the lateral load as $q = -k B_s w$, and thus the compression load writes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 = B \frac{h^2}{12} k^2 + \frac{B_s}{hk}.
\label{eq:sigma0}
\end{equation}

Minimizing $\sigma_0$ function of $k$ yield the well known~\cite{Biot1957,Cerda2003} result $hk = \left(6B_s/B\right)^{1/3}$ and thus the dominant wavelength is
\begin{equation}
\lambda_d = 2\pi h \left(\frac{B}{6B_s}\right)^{1/3}.
\label{eq:lambdaElEl}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Elastic film on a viscous layer}
The layer thickness $H$ is supposed much smaller than $\lambda_d$, we are thus in the lubrication approximation. Since we work at small deflections, we can neglect the displacement of the plate along $x$. The flux along $x$ is thus of the Poiseuille form
\begin{equation}
Q = -\frac{H^3}{12\eta}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.
\label{eq:PoiseuilleFlux}
\end{equation}
where $p(x)$ is the pressure in the layer of viscosity $\eta$.

Mass conservation writes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = 0.
\label{eq:conservation}
\end{equation}
Keeping only linear order terms, in operator language
\begin{equation}
\frac{12\eta}{\tau} \frac{w}{H^3k^2} = -q.
\label{eq:PoiseuilleLoad}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.~(\ref{eq:mecheqop}) and (\ref{eq:PoiseuilleLoad}), the compression load writes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 = \frac{1}{12}B h^2 k^2 + 12\frac{\eta}{\tau}\frac{1}{H^3 h k^4}
\label{eq:sigma0P}
\end{equation}
and can be minimised by $k_P$ such that
\begin{equation}
k_P^6 = 2\times 12^2 \frac{1}{h^3H^3\Upsilon},
\label{eq:kP}
\end{equation}
with $\Upsilon = B\tau/\eta$ the viscoelastic factor. The dominant wavelength for Poiseuille model is thus
\begin{equation}
\lambda_P = \pi\sqrt{hH}\left(\frac{2}{9}\Upsilon\right)^{1/6}
\end{equation}

The scaling is then identical to the (much more involved) derivation by \citet{Huang2002}. When the elastic film is sandwiched between two viscous layers of respective thickness $H_1$ and $H_2$, the linearity of Eq.~(\ref{eq:mecheq}) allows us to use an effective substrate of thickness 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{H^3} = \frac{1}{H_1^3}+\frac{1}{H_2^3}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Porous elastic film with no possible Poiseuille flow}
The lateral load derives from the Darcy law through the film of permeability $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
-q = p_2-p_1 = \frac{h\eta}{\alpha}\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}.
\label{eq:DarcyLoad}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.~(\ref{eq:mecheqop}) and (\ref{eq:DarcyLoad}), the compression load writes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_0 = \frac{1}{12}B h^2 k^2 + \frac{\eta}{\tau}\frac{1}{\alpha k^2}
\label{eq:sigma0D}
\end{equation}
and can be minimised by $k_D$ such that
\begin{equation}
k_D^4 = \frac{12}{h^2\alpha\Upsilon}.
\label{eq:kD}
\end{equation}

The dominant wavelength for Darcy model is thus
\begin{equation}
\lambda_D = 2\pi h^{1/2}\alpha^{1/4}\left(\frac{\Upsilon}{12}\right)^{1/4}.
\end{equation}


\subsubsection*{Porous elastic film between two viscous layers}
The mass conservation over the whole height of the cell yield $Q_1 + Q_2 = 0$ and thus
\begin{equation}
H_1^3 p_1 + H_2^3 p_2 = 0.
\label{eq:pressures}
\end{equation}

The mass conservation in the lower viscous layer is the same as Eq.~(\ref{eq:conservation}) with an added leak $v$ due to the porosity
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + v = 0.
\label{eq:conservationDarcy}
\end{equation}

$v$ can be expressed by the Darcy law
\begin{equation}
v = \frac{\alpha}{\eta} \frac{p_1-p_2}{h}.
\label{eq:Darcy}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.~(\ref{eq:pressures}, \ref{eq:conservationDarcy}, \ref{eq:Darcy}) we obtain the lateral load
\begin{equation}
q = p_1-p_2 = - \frac{\eta}{\tau} \frac{w}{\frac{H^3 k^2}{12} + \frac{\alpha}{h}},
\label{eq:MixtLoad}
\end{equation}

Note that we recover Eq~(\ref{eq:PoiseuilleLoad}) when $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ and Eq~(\ref{eq:DarcyLoad}) when $H \rightarrow 0$. We can recast this intuition in term of the dimensionless number $H/H^*$ where $H^*$ is obtained by equating $k_P$ and $k_D$:
\begin{equation}
H^* = 2^{2/3} 3^{1/6} \alpha^{1/2} \Upsilon^{1/6}.
\end{equation}

Analytic minimisation of $\sigma_0$ knowing $q$ is possible but heavy. Instead we rewrite Eq.~(\ref{eq:mecheqop}) in terms of previously calculated $\lambda_P$ and $\lambda_D$:
\begin{align}
\frac{12\sigma_0}{k_D^2 h^2 B} &= \left(\frac{k}{k_D}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2\frac{k_D^2}{k_P^6}k^4  + \left(\frac{k}{k_D}\right)^2}\\
&= \left(\frac{\lambda_D}{\lambda}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2\frac{\lambda_P^6}{\lambda_D^2\lambda^4}  + \left(\frac{\lambda_D}{\lambda}\right)^2}
\end{align}
and we minimise this expression numerically.
