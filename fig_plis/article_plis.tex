\section*{Methods summary}
To prevent adsorption of caseins to surfaces, microscope slides and cover-slips were cleaned and subsequently coated with a silane agent (3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, Sigma Aldrich) to which a polyacrylamide brush was polymerized from methacrylate groups.
Sodium caseinate (Firmenich) was labelled with Dylight~550 NHS ESTER (Thermo Scientific) and then purified by centrifugation. Unlabelled sodium caseinate powder was dissolved in deionised water (or water+glycerol mixture). To induce gelation glucono-$\delta$-lactone (GDL) in powder (Firmenich) was added to the solution. \SI{45}{\micro\litre} of this solution was immediately mixed with \SI{5}{\micro\litre} of labelled caseinate solution and injected in the microscopy cell, immediately sealed using ultraviolet-cured glue (Norland Optical) and placed under the microscope before gelation could take place. 
3D data were collected on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, using \SI{532}{\nano\meter} laser excitation. We used either 10x (air) lens to measure the geometry of wrinkling (see SM) or 63x (oil) lens to observe the microstructure of the gel. Larger scope pictures were obtained either by stitching fluorescent microscope data or by transmitted/reflected light macroscope (Nikkon SMZ745T/Leica DMS1000).
Data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification} a-b were obtained with a SevenCompact pH-meter (Mettler Toledo) and an MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar).

\subsection*{Microstructure measurement}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{mesh}
	\caption{Gel microstructure. (a) Detail of a confocal micrograph of a 4\%w casein, 4\%w GDL in water, when only the slide is coated (not the cover slip). Time corresponds to the minimum in mesh size. Scale bar is \SI{10}{\micro\metre}. (b) Corresponding radial averaged Fourier transform. Black line is the best fit by Eq.XXX with $\xi=\SI{4.9}{\micro\metre}$ and $\gamma=2.4$. Inset shows the center of the non radial average spectrum (arbitrary logarithmic color scale). Scale bar is \SI{10}{\per\micro\metre}. (c-d) Idem in a 50\%w glycerol solvent, with $\xi=\SI{1.5}{\micro\metre}$ and $\gamma=2.5$.}
	\label{fig:mesh}
\end{figure}

To follow the evolution of the microstructure in a gel undergoing syn\ae{}resis and swelling, we had to keep it in the thin focal plane of the 63x objective lens of the confocal microscope. To do so, we coated only the microscope slide with acrylamide brush to allow syn\ae{}resis on this side. The cover-slip was cleaned but not coated, thus keeping strong adhesion on the side closer to the objective lens. Neither buckling nor wrinkling was detected in such configuration.

We acquired slices of $(\SI{2048}{px})^2$ with pixels of \SI{98}{\nano\metre} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:mesh}a and c). After Hann windowing we performed Fourier transform (see insets of Fig.~\ref{fig:mesh}b and d) and radially averaged the resulting spectrum to obtain $I(q)$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:mesh}b and d) that we fit by the following fractal form:
\begin{equation}
I(q) = \frac{\chi}{1+(\xi q)^\gamma}
\end{equation}
were the susceptibility $\chi$ is related to the contrast of fluorescence between the network and the solvent, the cut off length $\xi$ corresponds to the largest pore size and the exponent $\gamma$ is loosely related to the fractal dimension. 

\subsection*{Permeability measurements}
\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics{permeability}
	\caption{Permeability measurements. (a) Schematic representation of the experiment. (b-c) Evolution of the height of the interface in tube 1 relative to the final height in tube 2. Black line is the best exponential fit $Ae^{-t/\tau}$. (b) Gel is 4\%w casein, 4\%w GDL in water, $H=\SI{2.3}{\milli\metre}$ and $\tau=\SI{57}{\minute}$. (c) Idem in 50\%w glycerol, $H=\SI{4}{\milli\metre}$ and $\tau=\SI{100}{\hour}$.}
	\label{fig:permeability}
\end{figure*}

To measure the permeability of our gels, we adapt a method from \cite{VanDijk1986}. First, the gel of interest is formed at the lower extremity of a thin glass tube. The tube is held vertical in a water saturated atmosphere to prevent evaporation until the pH has reached the isoelectric point ($\approx\SI{1}{\hour}$ for our most common composition). Then, we dip the tube in a bath of acetic acid/acetate buffer at pH=4. The buffer has the same glycerol content as the gel solvent, so that the viscosity is constant throughout the experiment. Alongside the first tube (see Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability} a), we dip a second identical tube with no gel in it. A webcam (Logitech Webcam Pro 9000) records the rise of the liquid in each tube. Since the liquid height in tube 2 reaches its final value quickly, we measure directly $z_\infty-z(t)$.

Darcy law through the gel of permeability $\alpha$ and height $H$ writes
\begin{equation}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\alpha}{\eta}\frac{\Delta P}{H}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta P$ is the the hydrostatic pressure relative to $z_\infty$. We can thus write
\begin{equation}
\frac{d(z_\infty-z)}{dt} = -\frac{z_\infty-z}{\tau}\text{, with\,} \tau = \frac{\eta H}{\alpha \rho g}.
\end{equation}

By fitting $z_\infty-z(t)$ by an exponential (see Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability} b-c), we obtain $\tau$ and thus $\alpha$. Note that even with $H$ of the order of a few millimetres high glycerol contents yield $\tau\approx \SI{100}{\hour}$ due both to high viscosities and low permeability. Obtaining $z_\infty$ without tube 2 would be time prohibitive.

\subsection*{Confocal images segmentation}

At 10x magnification, we acquired sacks of (depending on cell thickness) 20 to 50 images spaced by \SI{6.69}{\micro\metre} (Nyquist sampling). Each confocal slice was $(\SI{256}{px})^2$ with pixels of \SI{4.97}{\micro\metre}. At this low resolution details of the gel microstructure are undistinguishable ($\xi<$px for all compositions) and the gel appear as a continuous medium.

We first denoise each plane by a small Gaussian blur ($\sigma=\SI{2}{px}\ll\lambda$). Then, for each $(x,y)$, we focus on the z-dependant intensity profile $I(z)$. We define the position of the top surface of the gel $z_\text{top}$ as where $I(z)$ first crosses half of its maximum value. Since the criterion is local, we do not need to correct for background intensity variation. In this way we obtain $z_\text{top}(x,y)$ with subpixel resolution ($\pm\SI{0.1}{px}=\SI{0.67}{\micro\metre}$), and $z_\text{bottom}(x,y)$ in a symmetrical way.

From these data, we obtain for each stack the volume and thickness of the gel phase, area of the midsurface and peak-to-peak amplitude. Velocity is obtained by time differentiation. Once the instability has saturated on floor and ceiling of the cell, peaks in the histograms of $z_\text{top}$, and $z_\text{bottom}$ yield the measure of the positions of the walls, thus to $e$ and retrospectively to $H_1$ and $H_2$.

\subsection*{Characteristic time measurement}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{growth}
	\caption{Growth of the instability. (a) Evolution of the gel velocity $v$, integrated over the whole surface. Inset: Evolution of the amplitude (peak to peak measurement) in semi logarithmic scale. Black line is the best exponential fit with $\tau=\SI{90}{\second}$. (b) Evolution of the bottom profile of the gel from the onset of instability (yellow) to the contact to both walls (brown). Note that the lateral size of the blister evolve in this regime. Thick black curve is the profile at much longer time. Note that blister foot (highlighted by the orange vertical line) has not moved since contact.}
	\label{fig:growth}
\end{figure}

In most of our samples, it was possible to measure directly the peak-to-peak amplitude $A(t)$ from our confocal measurements. However when the wavelength is too large compared to the field of view, this approach breaks down since we cannot observe both highest and lowest point of the surface. Even when valid, such local measurement is noisy and we prefer the measure of the vertical displacement of the gel $v$ that can be integrated over the whole field of view.

We note that when both measurements were available (as in Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}a), the characteristic time $\tau$ obtained from the fit of the exponential growth of $A(t)$ was about $4A_\text{max}/v_\text{max}$, where $A_\text{max} = e-h$ is the amplitude when the gel comes in contact with both walls. We thus used consistently this approximation of $\tau$ for all our samples. This is coherent with the fact that the blister size $\propto\lambda$ does not evolve after contact (see Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}b), thus the kinetic wavelength is decided when $A(t) = A_\text{max}$.
