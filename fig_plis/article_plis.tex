\begin{abstract}
The slow acidification of milk proteins such as casein is well known to result in the formation of gels – this is indeed one of the key steps to make cheese or yogurt. Here, using the casein proteins as  building blocks and the acidifier  Glucono delta-lactone, we design model thin bio-gel layers that wrinkles in cascade. Using a combination of titration, rheology, light microscopy and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that, during the acidification, the gels shrink and swell creating constrains that induce Darcy and Poiseuille flows and wrinkles the gel. We have develop a hydrodynamic model that predict correctly the wrinkling wavelength. Our results should be universal for proteins as it is based on pH induced charge stabilasion/destablisation and control of boundary conditons. As such it could set a benchmark to gain fundamental insights into wrinkled biological tissues, to texture food or to design surfaces for optical puposes.

\section*{Introduction}


%There are many ways and reasons for a film to wrinkle. An elastic film buckles due to excess area with respect to its boundaries. Wrinkling is a buckling hindered by a substrate: the mismatch of elastic properties between the film and the substrate selects the preferred wrinkling wavelength~\cite{Gough1940, Bijlaard1946}. On the engineering side the last two decades have seen a bloom of methods to obtain well-controlled patterns via linear~\cite{Bowden1998, Genzer2006, Hu1998, Kim2010, Vandeparre2011, Li2013} or nonlinear wrinkling~\cite{Efimenko2005, Guvendiren2010, Kim2011a, Brau2011}. Such patterns can be triggered by temperature dilation, swelling or the removal of pre-strain. On the biology side wrinkling-controlled morphogenesis is ubiquitous: ageing and the loss of elastic fibres makes our skin wrinkles~\cite{Bissett1987, Genzer2006}, difference in growth rates between the gut tube and its dorsal anchoring is responsible for the vilification of guts~\cite{Savin2011, Ciarletta2014, Shyer2013}, localized cell death in biofilms focuses mechanical forces and initiates 3D labyrinth pattern~\cite{Trejo2013, Asally2012}. On the physics side analogues of wrinkling have been found in situations where an effective substrate comes from the resistance to uniaxial stretching~\cite{Cerda2003}, from gravity~\cite{Kolinski2009, Vella2009, Pineirua2013, Lucantonio2013}, from boundaries~\cite{Vandeparre2011a, Li2013} or from adhesion~\cite{Vella2009a}. Dealing only with (semi)infinite substrates, Biot generalised the elasticity of both the film and the substrate to viscoelasticity~\cite{Biot1957} or poroelasticity~\cite{Biot1964}, leading to time-dependent kinetic wavelength selection. Stability analysis of a film lying on a thin viscous substrate was studied only recently~\cite{Huang2002}. Since in practice gravity sets the wavelength in such situation~\cite{Smoluchowski1910}, the wrinkling on a confined viscous substrate has not been studied experimentally.

There are many ways and reasons for a film to wrinkle. An elastic film buckles due to excess area with respect to its boundaries and wrinkles when buckling is hindered by a substrate. The selection of the preferred wrinkling wavelength is peculiar to the situation and is related to the mismatch of elastic properties between the surface and the substrate~\cite{Gough1940, Bijlaard1946} XXX.  On the biology side wrinkling-controlled morphogenesis is ubiquitous. Ageing and the loss of elastic fibres makes our skin wrinkles~\cite{Bissett1987, Genzer2006}. Difference in growth rates between the gut tube and its dorsal anchoring is responsible for the vilification of guts~\cite{Savin2011, Ciarletta2014, Shyer2013}. Localized cell death in biofilms focuses mechanical forces and initiates 3D labyrinth pattern~\cite{Trejo2013, Asally2012}. On the physics side the last two decades have seen a bloom of methods to obtain well-controlled patterns via linear~\cite{Bowden1998, Genzer2006, Hu1998, Kim2010, Vandeparre2011, Li2013} or nonlinear behaviour~\cite{Efimenko2005, Guvendiren2010, Kim2011a, Brau2011}. Such patterns can be triggered by temperature dilation refXXX, swelling refXXX or the removal of pre-strain refXXX.

Yet,  benchmark experiments that explore the possibility of wrinkling in confined porous soft materials immersed in a buoyancy-matched viscous medium are in line, not only from a physics point of view, but also to get fundamental insights into biologically relevant situation. Indeed, stability analysis of a film lying on a thin viscous substrate was studied only recently~\cite{Huang2002} and remains theoretical because, on a free interface, gravity dominates over viscous substrate. In a biological context, thin tissues, e.g. epithelimum or endothelium, are naturally confined and immersed in a nearly buoyant medium, e.g. lymph, blood or mucus, a practical situation where a thin viscous substrate would set the wrinkling wavelength. Moreover, most biological films are porous, and little is known on the interplay between permeability and wrinkling~\cite{Ma2004,Longley2013}.

Here, we introduce model permeable biogels that produce hierarchical wrinkling as a result of their interplay between their gelation dynamics and the confinement conditions. In slit geometry, we slowly acidify a dispersion of casein, one of the milk proteins.  As a result, not only does the casein form a gel as expected~\cite{Bremer1989} --this is a well-known effect used in cheese or yogurt making-- but the gel starts to produce wrinkling patterns in cascade when casein adhesion to the slit walls is turned off. Using a combination of rheology, light microscopy and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that upon acidification the casein network spontaneously shrinks then swells at the micron level and wrinkles at the millimetre scale. We systematically investigate such swelling-induced wrinkling of a porous gel film sandwiched between two viscous layers, the whole system being confined between two glass plates. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics} and in Supplementary Movies 1 and 2, transverse confinement leads to saturation of the amplitude on both the top and bottom walls followed by a cascade of secondary and ternary buckling. Such cascade buckling has already been observed by~\cite{Roman1999} in a one-dimensional macroscopic system, a sheet of steel forced to buckle between two solid plates. In addition one has to note that the primary wavelength is much smaller than the size of the system, implying that a simple buckling scenario cannot explain the observations in Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics} and that only a wrinkling instability can be invoked.

The main goal of the present study is thus to identify the selection mechanism of the wavelength. In the following we first describe the physical chemistry that allows us to form such patterns. Then we  model the situation and identify two possible selection mechanisms, namely porous Darcy flow or viscous Poiseuille flow. Comparing our experimental data to these two models we finally show that a combination of both Darcy and Poiseuille mechanisms accurately describes our data. This combined model pins down the dynamical origin of the constraints exerted on the gel and nicely predicts the wrinkling wavelength.

To form wrinkled patterns such as the one oberved in figure 1XXX, ones needs to take advantage of the pH sensitivity of casein to control the route to gelation, to fine tune the gel properties and the boundary conditions.

the stability of casein dispersion strongly depend on the pH of the solution. Supplementary movie 3XXX shows the titration of a casein dispertion at 1\%w by 1 molar HCl. At pH=7, the casein is well dispersed then it floculate between pH= XXX to XXX and finaly at pH=XXX the solution become clear again. However as one increases the casein concentration up to 4\%w, at low pH the casein redispersion is not total, Supplementary movie 4XXX. The state diagram of casein as a function of the pH  is related to charge stabilization. At neutral pH casein are charged negatively and repel each other. As the pH decreases to the isoelectric point of the caseine (pH=4.5), caseine molecules loose their negative net charge and tend to stick to each other [ref XXX casein stability]. Beyond the isoelectric point casein acquire a positive net charge and therefore partialy re-disolve. In figure 2cXXX, we quantify this effect and measure with UV absorption spectroscopie the amount of free casein within the 4\%w dispersion as a function of pH (see Supplementary Methods). Starting at pH=6.8 all the casein molecules are well dispersed and the free casein fraction is 1. Upon decreasing the pH of the solution to the isolectric point the free casein fraction drop to almost 0, almost all the casein molecule are aggregated. Further decrease of the pH of the solution lead to a partial redisolution of the casein agregate. At pH=2 the fraction of free casein is XXX.

%On the Stability of Casein Micelles, Pieter Walstra J. of dairy science 1990

To form a space spaning gel, floculation need to be prevented. We use of Glucono delta-lactone (GDL) a molecule  that slowly hydrlolyses into an acid and thus lowers slowly, continuously and homogeneously the pH of the medium, fig.2aXXX. This GDL controled acidification permits the formation of a bulk gel phase. We monitor the GDL induced gelation with a rheometer in cone plate geometry. As casein strongly adsorbs to surfaces, the strain and stress are well transmitted to the casein dispersion and we can measure the elatic and viscous modulus of the casein dispersion as a function of time. the mechanical properties of the gel are closely related to the fraction of free casein. First, the dispersion solidifies then reaches its maximum elasticity (500 Pa) at the isoelectric point and finaly the elastic modulus decreases down to 100 Pa.

To gain further insight into the mechanical properties of the gel we turn to micro structural observations under confocal microscopy. As shown in supplementary fig. 1XXX the gel consist in a space spaning fractal network with a curtoff length scale xi. xi corresponds to the maximum pore size of the network. This model fits the structure at all times but its parameters vary non monotoneously during GDL acidification. As shown in Fig. 2cXXX, up to the isolectric point xi increases up to a maximum length of 7 $\mu$m due to the solvent expulsion out of the casein network [refXXX]. This stiffen the arm of the network and is responsible for the increase of elasticity. Beyond the isoelectric point xi decreases down to 4$\mu$m. Casein regain solubility [refXXX], the strand network swell, the pore shrinks and the gel weakens.

As seen on the confocal measurements, the gel is porous and is permeable to the solvant.  This protertie is determinant as it allow the gel to absord and expel the solvant and therefore change its volume when sticky boundary are turned off. To quantify this effect, we have embeded the casein gel inside a capillary and deeped verticaly the capilary in an aqueous buffer [refXXX]. In the supplementary figure XXX, we observe that the aqueous buffer goes through the gel and rise in the tube due to capillary forces. Exploitation of this experiment give the permeability of the gel: 67000 nm$^2$.

Boundary conditions is the final parameter that is essential to form wrinkled patterns. The evolution of xi when sticky boundaries are on reflects the inner constrains of the gel:  xi increases, the stand of the nework become thinner and the gel wants to retract; then xi decreases, the stands of network swell and the gel wants to expend. When the casein adhesion to the upper boundary is turned off, the gel still not wrinkles because it remains attached to the bottom wall, but it detach from the top wall. In this situation we can monitor xi, fig. XXX. xi remains mostly constant and the major effect is repported on the volume occupied by the gel as will be repported below.


%We coat the glass slides with acrylamide brushes to prevent the adhesion of the casein. In fig.2c, when the top slide of the optical cell is coated with acrylamide brushes, we then observe that the casein network detaches from the top slide. xi does not peak at the isoelectric point but remains constant

%Boundary conditions is the final parameter that is essential to form wrinkled patterns. Once the space spanning network is formed and sticks to the container, protein attraction can only proceed by local shrinking of the protein agregates, leading to larger pores.

%The difference in value of xi between the fully un-coated  and the half-coated optical cell demonstrate that the gel is subject to constrains as the pH decreases. The relaxation of thoses constrain is key to the wrinkling formation when both the top and bottom slide are coated with acrylamide brushes.

%The slow acidification of a protein (sodium caseinate) solution down to the isoelectric pH induces gelation~\cite{Bremer1989} (Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification}a). Since caseins strongly adsorb to interfaces, the resulting gel sticks to the container walls, allowing rheological measurements (Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification}b). Further decrease of the pH beyond the isoelectric point makes the casein aggregates swell (Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:nonmonotonic}), thus weakening the gel~\cite{Braga2006}. In a microscopy cell of slit geometry coated so that the casein cannot adsorb on the top wall, this microscopic nonmonotonic behaviour translates into little variation of the pore size $\xi$ but to solvent expulsion out of the gel phase (syn\ae{}resis) followed by global swelling (Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification}c and Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:nonmonotonic}).

\section*{Dynamics of the wrinkling process}

Figure~\ref{fig:sideview}a shows confocal measurements in the case where both top and bottom walls have been coated, a configuration favorable to wrinkling. Up to 10 min the dispersion is homogeneous and fills the entire slit. The black margins correspond to the glass walls. Around 23 min, the gel forms and simultaneously becomes thiner and more concentrated - the fluorescence signal which is proportional to the casein concentration is brighter compared to the situation at 10min. This effect is the fingerprint of syn\ae{}resis: as gelation proceeds, the solvent is expeled on both the upper and lower sides. We describe sample as a porous elastic film of thickness $h$ sandwiched between two viscous layers of respective thicknesses $H_1$ and $H_2$ in a cell of thickness $e=H_1+h+H_2$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}b). Extracting the top and bottom surface of the gel phase allows for quantitative measurements of the relative volume (Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}c) and excess surface area of the gel film (Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}d) (see Supplementary Methods). As expected from the system design, the evolution of the volume is non-monotoneous. After reaching a minimum around 35\% of its initial value at 23 min, the volume increases. Shortly after,  at 36 min, the planar film destabilizes and starts to wrinkle in the $z$-direction creating excess area. This confirms that the instability is due to swelling. Around 38 min, the amplitude of the wrinkles reach the thickness of the slit. The size of the primary pattern is now settled Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:patterns, fig:growth}. However swelling continues, the gel flattens on both top and bottom walls (44 min) and finally buckles back (53 min) to form the secondary pattern (1h21). When the excess volume saturates, the dynamics stops. The amount of GDL controls the ability of the gel to swell: at low GDL concentrations we only observe the primary pattern, at high GDL concentrations we have observe the formation of higher order patterns. 

Note that adhesion to side walls is necessary to prevent total syn\ae{}resis and thus allow subsequent planar stresses to develop while swelling: the only situation were wrinkling was observed is when both top and bottom walls are coated with acrylamide brushes. We also confirmed that at any given point in time and space the thickness $h$ of the film of gel is homogeneous. The contrast in transmission microscopy (Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics}a) is therefore not due to thickness inhomogeneities but to altitude gradients. Indeed the length of the optical path along the vertical direction $z$ through the gel phase is larger where the gel makes a slope compared to a flat situation, as indicated by the yellow vertical lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:sideview}b.

\section*{Models and scaling laws}

%Longitudinally constrained swelling of the gel film is the origin and driving force of the buckling instability. The gel area becomes in excess compared to the available area, thus the gel must fold. However, this does not explains how a wavelength is selected.

The determination of the characteristic length $\lambda$ of a wrinkling pattern is an old problem. Large deformations of thin sheets is governed by F\"{o}ppl-von Karman equations  refLaudauXXX,  essentially impossible to solve in analytical form. However using scaling and asymptotic arguments one can obtain the dominant wavelength of the wrinking patern and isolate the physically meaningful ingredients. An elastic film buckles due to excess area with respect to its boundaries. Wrinkling is a buckling hindered by a substrate: the mismatch of elastic properties between the film and the substrate selects the preferred wrinkling wavelength~\cite{Gough1940, Bijlaard1946}. $\lambda$ is then set by the competition between the flexural modulus of the film $B=E/(1-\nu^2)$ ($E$ Young modulus, $\nu$ Poisson ratio) and a transverse load $\sigma_\perp$. For small deflections of  amplitude $A$, $\lambda$ scales as~\cite{Vella2009,Kolinski2009}: 
%
\begin{equation}
\lambda \sim \left( A h^3 \frac{B}{\sigma_{\perp}} \right)^{1/4}.
\label{eq:lstar}
\end{equation}


%L. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz, Theory of Elasticity (Pergamon, New York, 1986), 3rd ed.

This framework has been successfully applied to situations where $\sigma_{\perp}$ comes from the resistance of an elastic substrate ~\cite{Gough1940, Bijlaard1946}. Dealing only with (semi)infinite substrates, Biot generalised the elasticity of both the film and the substrate to viscoelasticity~\cite{Biot1957} or poroelasticity~\cite{Biot1964}, leading to time-dependent kinetic wavelength selection. Futhermore, \ref{eq:lstar} remains valids even when $\sigma_{\perp}$ comes from the resistance to uniaxial stretching~\cite{Cerda2003}, from gravity~\cite{Smoluchowski1910, Kolinski2009, Vella2009, Pineirua2013, Lucantonio2013}, from boundaries~\cite{Vandeparre2011a, Li2013} or from adhesion~\cite{Vella2009a}.

In our situation we now have to determine $\sigma_\perp$. We identify three possible candidates for the transverse load $\sigma_\perp$: the weight or buoyancy of the gel, the porous flow through the gel or the viscous flows in the surrounding water layers. We confirmed that gravity plays no significant role by successfully repeating the wrinkling patern in a cell held vertically, i.e. with the weight acting longitudinally rather than transversely.

Prefactors are 0.63, 0.69 and 0.67 respectively. The dashed line is the best affine fit ($\lambda_{\rm exp}=0.52\lambda_{P}+\SI{0.33}{\milli\metre}$) to all the points in (b).}
	\label{fig:DarcyPoiseuille}
\end{figure*}

We consider two limit scenario that leads to wrinkling parterns. In a first limit, the film of gel sits without sticking to the bottom wall of the cell ($H_1\rightarrow0$). Creating a 2D blister requires flowing solvent of viscosity $\eta$ through the gel of permeability $\alpha$. Darcy law~\cite{Darcy1856} relates the pressure gradient, estimated as $\sigma_{\perp}/h$, to the volume flux per unit area $v = \frac{\alpha}{\eta}\frac{\sigma_{\perp}}{h} = \frac{dA}{dt}$. Injecting this expression in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lstar}) yields the wavelength of the Darcy mode as
\begin{equation}
\lambda_D \sim h^{1/2} \alpha^{1/4} \Upsilon^{1/4}
\end{equation}
where $\Upsilon = B\tau/\eta$ is a dimensionless viscoelastic factor quantifying the relative stiffness of the film and the solvent at a characteristic time $\tau$. This expression emphasizes the kinetic nature of the wavelength selection through Darcy flow. However we note that the wavelength of a generation of the pattern does not evolve with time (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics}a and Sup. Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}) once the gel is touching both walls. This arrest may be due to bending rigidity~\cite{LeGoff2014}. Here the relevant time scale $\tau$ corresponds to the times it takes for the wrinkle amplitude to saturate (see Supplementary Method for the precise definition).

The opposite limiting case is when the gel film lies in the middle of the cell ($H_1=H_2$) and impermeable ($\alpha\rightarrow 0$). There destabilisation over a wavelength $\lambda$ creates a lubrication ($H\ll\lambda$) flow in the viscous layers. By symmetry the transverse load across the gel $\sigma_{\perp}$ is also the pressure difference over the wavelength. Using a Poiseuille profile for the flow, $\frac{dA}{dt} \sim \sigma_{\perp} \frac{H^3}{\eta\lambda^2}$~\cite{Poiseuille1842}. Injecting this expression in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lstar}) yields the wavelength of the Poiseuille mode as
\begin{equation}
\lambda_P \sim (hH)^{1/2} \Upsilon^{1/6}
\end{equation}
where we recognize the scaling for the wrinkles of an elastic film on a thin ($H\ll\lambda$) elastic substrate~\cite{Cerda2003} where $\Upsilon$ would be the ratio between the flexural modulus of the film and that of the substrate. Indeed within the lubrication approximation or at low Reynolds numbers one can consider a viscous film as elastic with effective Young modulus $3\eta/\tau$~\cite{Biot1957,Boudaoud2001}.

A more complete derivation of the models can be found in the Supplementary Method and yields the following prefactors:
\begin{align}
\lambda_D &= 2\pi h^{1/2}\alpha^{1/4}\left(\frac{\Upsilon}{12}\right)^{1/4}\\
\lambda_P &= \pi (hH)^{1/2}\left(\frac{2}{9}\Upsilon\right)^{1/6}
\end{align}
where $1/H^3 = 1/H_1^3 + 1/H_2^3$. The crossover between the two models where $\lambda_D=\lambda_P$ is found for $H = H^* \equiv 2^{2/3} 3^{1/6} \alpha^{1/2} \Upsilon^{1/6}$.

To sum up, we expect two regimes of viscosity-dominated wrinkling: for $H\ll H^*$ the main dissipation mechanism would be the flow through the porous film, whereas for $H\gg H^*$ the flow in the viscous layers would dominate and set the wavelength.

\section*{Experimental tests}

For a typical gel sheet (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data}b) the buoyancy after syn\ae{}resis is estimated as $\Delta\rho=\SI{130}{\kilo\gram\per\cubic\metre}$ leading to a gravity stress $\sigma_\perp^G \approx \SI{0.04}{\pascal}$. This is much lower than typical Darcy or Poiseuille stresses $\sigma_\perp^D \approx \sigma_\perp^P \approx \SI{0.15}{\pascal}$ and therefore gravity is dismissed.


Darcy and Poiseuille models yield wavelengths that are of the same order in most of the cases under study. Thus only systematic measurements of the experimental $\lambda$ together with estimates for all the parameters involved in either model shall allow one to discriminate between them (see Supplementary Method for details on such measurements). As summarized in Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data} we systematically varied (i) the thickness of the cell, impacting $h$ and the maximal amplitude, (ii) the gel composition and thus both its stiffness and its permeability, (iii) the viscosity of the solvent by adding glycerol, which also impacted the gel stiffness, permeability and $\tau$. Finally, the only parameter that we had no control upon was the initial altitude $H$ of the gel before wrinkling that varied randomly. However we were able to obtain more data at small $H/H^*$ ratios by considering not only the primary patterns but also the secondary ones. Since the saturation of the primary pattern flattens the gel on the top and bottom walls, the secondary blisters always appear in a Darcy situation ($H\ll H^*$). Here the wavelength associated to the secondary blister is taken as half of that of the primary pattern as shown in Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:generations}.

Our results are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:DarcyPoiseuille}. Although they provide the correct order of magnitude for $\lambda$, neither model alone is able to quantitatively reproduce the full data set. However considering only the points where $H<H^*$ (respectively $H>H^*$), the Darcy (resp. Poiseuille) model fits the data well albeit with a prefactor. Note that it would be easy to miss out on the failure of the Poiseuille model at small wavelengths by adding an unexplained offset (dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:DarcyPoiseuille}b). Nonetheless, a complete model (derived in Supplementary Methods), summing up the influence of both Poiseuille and Darcy dissipation shows a better agreement for all values of $H/H^*$.

\section*{conclusion}

In conclusion we have taken advantage of the properties of the protein casein and carefully ingineered the route to form permeable bio-gels that, in slit geometry,  produce original cascade of wrinkling patterns  when casein adhesion to the slit walls is turned off.  We developed a model that captures the dynamical origin of the constrains exerted on the gel and predict the wrinkling wavelength: Poiseuille flows of the solvent above and below the gel layer for long wavelengths and a new mechanism, Darcy flows of the solvent through the gel layer for short wavelengths. Such a model experiment, because it relies on pH induced charge stabilisation/destablisation, should be generalisable to different sort of proteins. As such it illustrate daily life problems such as wrinkles encountered while putting up wall paper and could set a benchmark to explore potential applications in food sience refXXX or in optical devices such as diffraction gratins or fresnel lenses refXXX, and the possibility of wrinkling in confined porous soft materials immersed in a buoyancy-matched viscous medium such as biological tissues refXXX.

\section*{Methods summary}

Sodium caseinate (Firmenich)  is disolved in deionised water by stiring for 20 min  at room temperature.  The mixing of the caseine dispersion with glucono-$\delta$-lactone (GDL) in powder (Firmenich) marks the begining of the experiments. We tipically have about 10 min to pipette the dispersion in the slit before gelation starts. Sodium caseinate (Firmenich) is labelled with Dylight~550 NHS ESTER (Thermo Scientific). Excess dye is removed by centrifugation. For confocal microscopy measurements, we add 10\% of fluorescently labelled caseines to the caseine/GDL dispersion while it is fluid.

Home made optical cells are composed of a slide (RS France) and a cover slip (Menzel-Gl\"aser) spaced by parafilm (Parafilm). The optical cell is heated  on a hot plate so that the parafilm welds to the  slide and the cover slip. Gently applying a pressure on the cover slip while being heated allows us to tune the thickness of the cell between 50 et 150 $\mu$m. The slit is filled with the casein dispersion, immediately sealed using ultraviolet-cured glue (Norland Optical) and placed under the microscope before gelation could take place. To prevent adsorption of caseins to surfaces, microscope slides and cover slips used to make microscopy cells are cleaned and subsequently coated with a silane agent (3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, Sigma Aldrich) to which a polyacrylamide brush is polymerized from methacrylate groups (euromedex).

3D data are collected on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, using \SI{532}{\nano\meter} laser excitation. We use either a 10x (air) lens to measure the geometry of wrinkling (see Supplementary Material) or a 63x (oil) lens to observe the microstructure of the gel. Larger scope pictures, obtained either by stitching fluorescent microscopy images (Nikon Eclipse Ti) or by transmitted/reflected light macroscope (Nikon SMZ745T/Leica DMS1000) are used to measure the wavelength of the primary pattern (Supplementary Figures~\ref{fig:patterns} and \ref{fig:generations}). Secondary pattern wavelength is set to half of the primary wavelength, according to Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:generations}.
Data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:acidification} a-b are obtained with a SevenCompact pH-meter (Mettler Toledo) and an MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar).
Permeability is measured using a protocol found in \cite{VanDijk1986} (see Supplementary Method and Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability}). The amount of free casein protein present in the gel during the GDL acidificaition process was measured by titration and UV-spectrometry (Ocean Optics) according to the protocol found in [refXXX]

\subsection*{Fraction of free casein proteins as a function of the pH}

the fraction of free casein proteins of a 100mL, 4\%w sodium caseinate dispersion is obtained either by titration by HCl 1 molar or during the action of 4\%w GDL. In both cases, 0.4mL of the 100mL dispersion is sampled regularly as a function of the pH, and centrifuged in eppendorf tubes at 14500 rpm for 3 min. The supernatent is diluted and analysed with a UV absorption spectrometer(Ocean Optics). According to refXXX, we deduced the fraction of free casein proteins from the adsorption spectrum:
%
\begin{equation}
x_{free}=\frac{A(\text{pH})}{A(\text{pH}=7)}\text{, with } A(\text{pH})=A_{280}-A_{320}XXX
\end{equation}
%
where  $A_{280}$ is the absortion peak due to XXX and $A_{320}$ is an estimate of the absorption due to turbidity. 

\subsection*{Microstructure measurement}

	\label{fig:nonmonotonic}%
\end{figure}

To follow the evolution of the microstructure of the gel, we acquired slices of $(\SI{2048}{px})^2$ with pixels of \SI{98}{\nano\metre} (Fig.~\ref{fig:nonmonotonic}a). After Hann windowing we performed Fourier transform and radially averaged the resulting spectrum to obtain $I(q)$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:nonmonotonic}b) that was fitted by the following fractal form:
\begin{equation}
I(q) = \frac{2\chi\Gamma(d)}{\left(1+\left((d+1)\xi q\right)^2\right)^{d/2}}
\label{eq:fractalS}
\end{equation}
where the susceptibility $\chi$ is related to the fluorescence contrast between the network and the solvent, the cut off length $\xi$ corresponds to the largest pore size and $d$ is the fractal dimension. $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. Eq.~(\ref{eq:fractalS}) is a good approximation to the 2D Fourier transform of a fractal pair correlation function $g(r) \sim 1+ e^{-r/\xi} r^{d-2}$.
%En 3D on peut citer \cite{Martin1987,Chen1986}

Figure~\ref{fig:acidification}c of the main text and Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:nonmonotonic}c and d show the evolution of the fitting parameters in two different sets of boundary conditions: (i) complete adhesion of the gel on all walls, preventing syn\ae{}resis and swelling; (ii) complete adhesion except on the top wall, allowing syn\ae{}resis and swelling. The later situation is a proxy to the situation where we observe wrinkling, since it was necessary to keep the gel into the thin focal plane of the 63x objective lens of the confocal microscope. To do so, we coated only the microscope slide with acrylamide brush. The cover slip was cleaned but not coated, thus keeping strong adhesion on the side closer to the objective lens. Neither buckling nor wrinkling was detected in such configuration.

In situation (i), the gel keeps its topology throughout the gelation and over acidification. Left of Fig.~\ref{fig:nonmonotonic}a shows that the arms of the gel first shrink laterally while keeping their length, and then swell again. Syn\ae{}resis and swelling are thus local processes. By contrast in situation (ii), the gel as a whole compresses while forming. Since our focal plane is a fixed depth, we cannot follow the topology of the same subset of the network, however the pore size is clearly smaller than in situation (ii). The isoelectric gel, at minimum gel volume, is probably isotropic or only marginally anisotropic in $z$. This explains that subsequent swelling is not occurring only along $z$ but also in plane, causing buckling.

$\xi$ was also systematically measured in the same way at the end of each wrinkling experiment and reported in Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data} of the main text. %Final fractal dimension was always close to 2 within error bars. Comparing $\chi$ across different setting of the microscope is not relevant.



\subsection*{Confocal images processing}

At 10x magnification and depending on cell thickness, we acquired stacks 20 to 50 images spaced by \SI{6.69}{\micro\metre} (Nyquist sampling). Each confocal slice was $(\SI{256}{px})^2$ with pixels of \SI{4.97}{\micro\metre}. At such low resolution details of the gel microstructure are undistinguishable as $\xi$ is smaller than the pixel size for all compositions and the gel appears as a continuous medium.

We first denoise each plane by a short-range Gaussian blur ($\sigma=\SI{2}{px}\ll\lambda$). Then, for each $(x,y)$, we focus on the z-dependent intensity profile $I(z)$. We define the position of the top surface of the gel $z_\text{top}$ as the point where $I(z)$ first crosses half of its maximum value over the given vertical line. Since this criterion is local, we do not need to correct for background intensity variation. In this way we obtain $z_\text{top}(x,y)$ with subpixel resolution ($\pm\SI{0.1}{px}=\SI{0.67}{\micro\metre}$), and $z_\text{bottom}(x,y)$ in a symmetrical way.

From these data, we obtain for each stack the volume and thickness of the gel phase, area of the midsurface and peak-to-peak amplitude. Velocity is obtained by time differentiation. Once the instability has saturated on the top and bottom walls of the cell, peaks in the histograms of $z_\text{top}$ and $z_\text{bottom}$ yield the measure of the positions of both walls, thus of the cell thickness $e$ and retrospectively of $H_1$ and $H_2$.



\subsection*{Mixed Darcy--Poiseuille model}

\subsubsection*{General framework for wrinkling}

The mechanical equilibrium of a plate of thickness $h$, Young modulus $E$ and Poisson ratio $\nu$ submitted to a compression load $\sigma_\parallel$ along $x$ and a transverse load $\sigma_\perp$ along $z$ writes
\begin{equation}
\frac{E h^3}{12(1-\nu^2)}\frac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} + \sigma_\parallel h \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} = \sigma_\perp,
\label{eq:mecheq}
\end{equation}
where $w(x,t)$ is the deflection of the plate along $z$~\cite{Biot1957}. Since we deal with slow rates of deformation, inertia is neglected.

We decomposed the deflection in sinusoidal modes $w(x,t) =  A \sin qx$ of wavevector $q$. Eq.~(\ref{eq:mecheq}) then reads
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{1}{12} B h^3 q^4 - \sigma_\parallel h q^2\right)w = \sigma_\perp,
\label{eq:mecheqop}
\end{equation}
where $B=E/(1-\nu^2)$ is the modulus of the plate.

Following \cite{Biot1957}, we consider the case where the compression load $\sigma_\parallel$ is increased quasistatically. The observed mode is the one that arises at the lowest possible $\sigma_\parallel$, i.e. the mode minimising $\sigma_\parallel$.

\subsubsection*{Elastic film in an infinite elastic medium}

In this framework, we recall here the well known case of an elastic film lying over an infinite elastic medium. The deformation of the substrate of modulus $B_s$ gives the transverse load as $\sigma_\perp = -q B_s w$, and thus the compression load writes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\parallel = B \frac{h^2}{12} q^2 + \frac{B_s}{hq}.
\label{eq:sigma0}
\end{equation}

Minimizing $\sigma_\parallel$ as a function of $q$ yields the well-known result $hq = \left(6B_s/B\right)^{1/3}$ \cite{Biot1957,Cerda2003} so that the dominant wavelength is 
\begin{equation}
\lambda = 2\pi h \left(\frac{B}{6B_s}\right)^{1/3}.
\label{eq:lambdaElEl}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Elastic film on a viscous layer}
Let us now turn to the case of an elastic, impermeable film on a single viscous layer. As \cite{Huang2002} we neglect gravity, although it is difficult to do so in practice at a free interface. Assuming the layer thickness $H$ to be much smaller than $\lambda_d$, we can use the lubrication approximation. Further considering only small deflections, we may neglect the displacement of the plate along $x$. The flux along $x$ is thus of the Poiseuille form
\begin{equation}
Q = -\frac{H^3}{12\eta}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.
\label{eq:PoiseuilleFlux}
\end{equation}
where $p(x)$ is the pressure in the layer of viscosity $\eta$.

Mass conservation writes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = 0.
\label{eq:conservation}
\end{equation}

Assuming an exponentially growing amplitude $A(t) = A_0 \exp(t/\tau)$ and keeping only linear order terms, one gets
\begin{equation}
\frac{12\eta}{\tau} \frac{w}{H^3q^2} = -\sigma_\perp.
\label{eq:PoiseuilleLoad}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.~(\ref{eq:mecheqop}) and (\ref{eq:PoiseuilleLoad}), the compression load writes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\parallel = \frac{1}{12}B h^2 q^2 + 12\frac{\eta}{\tau}\frac{1}{H^3 h q^4}
\label{eq:sigma0P}
\end{equation}
and is minimized at $q_P$ such that
\begin{equation}
q_P^6 = 2\times 12^2 \frac{1}{h^3H^3\Upsilon},
\label{eq:qP}
\end{equation}
with $\Upsilon = B\tau/\eta$ the viscoelastic factor. The dominant wavelength for the Poiseuille model is thus
\begin{equation}
\lambda_P = \pi\sqrt{hH}\left(\frac{2}{9}\Upsilon\right)^{1/6}
\end{equation}

We note that the mode minimising $\sigma_\parallel$ is also maximising the growth rate
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{H^3q^2}{12^2\eta}\left(12\sigma_\parallel - Bh^3q^4\right).
\end{equation}

When the elastic film is sandwiched between two viscous layers of respective thickness $H_1$ and $H_2$, the linearity of Eq.~(\ref{eq:mecheq}) allows us to use an effective substrate of thickness 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{H^3} = \frac{1}{H_1^3}+\frac{1}{H_2^3}.
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the experimental case where the gel film is far from both of the cell walls. Since we have an almost buoyant gel and no more free surface gravity can indeed be neglected.

\subsubsection*{Porous elastic film with no possible Poiseuille flow}
Another limiting case is that of a porous elastic film immersed in a viscous medium where longitudinal resistance to flow is infinite. It is the case in our experiments when the film is at contact with one of the walls. The only way to deform the film is to flow some liquid through the film of permeability $\alpha$. The transverse load derives from the Darcy law:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\perp = p_1-p_2 = \frac{h\eta}{\alpha}\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}.
\label{eq:DarcyLoad}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.~(\ref{eq:mecheqop}) and (\ref{eq:DarcyLoad}), the compression load writes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\parallel = \frac{1}{12}B h^2 q^2 + \frac{\eta}{\tau}\frac{1}{\alpha q^2}
\label{eq:sigma0D}
\end{equation}
and is minimized at $q_D$ such that
\begin{equation}
q_D^4 = \frac{12}{h^2\alpha\Upsilon}.
\label{eq:qD}
\end{equation}

The dominant wavelength for Darcy model is thus
\begin{equation}
\lambda_D = 2\pi h^{1/2}\alpha^{1/4}\left(\frac{\Upsilon}{12}\right)^{1/4}.
\end{equation}
Here also the dominant mode maximises the growth rate.


\subsubsection*{Porous elastic film between two viscous layers}
Finally the most realistic scenario mixes both Poiseuille and Darcy mechanisms, i.e. considers a porous elastic film between two viscous layers of arbitrary thickness. In this case, the mass conservation $Q_1 + Q_2 = 0$ over the whole height of the cell yields
\begin{equation}
H_1^3 p_1 + H_2^3 p_2 = 0.
\label{eq:pressures}
\end{equation}

The mass conservation in the lower viscous layer is the same as Eq.~(\ref{eq:conservation}) with an added leak $v$ due to the porosity
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + v = 0.
\label{eq:conservationDarcy}
\end{equation}

$v$ can be expressed by the Darcy law
\begin{equation}
v = \frac{\alpha}{\eta} \frac{p_1-p_2}{h}.
\label{eq:Darcy}
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs.~(\ref{eq:pressures}, \ref{eq:conservationDarcy}, \ref{eq:Darcy}) we obtain the transverse load
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\perp = p_1-p_2 = - \frac{\eta}{\tau} \frac{w}{\frac{H^3 q^2}{12} + \frac{\alpha}{h}},
\label{eq:MixtLoad}
\end{equation}

Note that we recover Eq~(\ref{eq:PoiseuilleLoad}) when $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ and Eq.~(\ref{eq:DarcyLoad}) when $H \rightarrow 0$. We can recast this intuition in terms of the dimensionless number $H/H^*$ where $H^*$ is obtained by equating $q_P$ and $q_D$:
\begin{equation}
H^* = 2^{2/3} 3^{1/6} \alpha^{1/2} \Upsilon^{1/6}.
\end{equation}

Analytic minimization of $\sigma_\parallel$ knowing $\sigma_\perp$ is possible but cumbersome. Instead we rewrite Eq.~(\ref{eq:mecheqop}) in terms of previously calculated $\lambda_P$ and $\lambda_D$:
\begin{align}
\frac{12\sigma_\parallel}{q_D^2 h^2 B} &= \left(\frac{q}{q_D}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2\frac{q_D^2}{q_P^6}q^4  + \left(\frac{q}{q_D}\right)^2}\\
&= \left(\frac{\lambda_D}{\lambda}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2\frac{\lambda_P^6}{\lambda_D^2\lambda^4}  + \left(\frac{\lambda_D}{\lambda}\right)^2}
\end{align}
and we minimize this expression numerically.

\subsection*{Wavelength measurement}

	\includegraphics{generations}%

	\label{fig:generations}%
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics{patterns}
	\caption{Patterns corresponding to the samples of Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data} of the main text. (a-d) increasing cell thickness. (e-f) larger solid content. (g-i) increasing glycerol content. All pictures are stitching of fluorescent microscopy images except (c,e) which are details of reflected light macroscope images. The scale is common to all panels (scale bar \SI{1}{\milli\metre}). Length of arrows correspond to the measured primary wavelength.}
	\label{fig:patterns}
\end{figure*}

To measure wrinkle wavelength, we used large field pictures of the final state. These picture were obtained either by stitching fluorescent microscopy images obtained at 10x magnification (Fig.~\ref{fig:patterns} except c and e), or by transmitted or reflected light macroscope at magnifications ranging from 1x to 6x (Fig.~\ref{fig:patterns}c and e). The contrast in such pictures is a measure of the magnitude of the altitude gradient of the gel film. White lines in fluorescence and reflection (respectively black lines in transmission) denote a sharp transition between two extreme altitudes (on top wall or on bottom wall). It is thus possible to reconstruct a binary picture of the pattern (inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:generations}). Furthermore since the shape and size of a given generation of pattern do not change after formation, it is possible to revert the final picture to pure first generation.

Figure~\ref{fig:generations} shows Fourier spectra of binarised altitudes at different times. When only the first generation pattern is present a peak clearly indicates the dominant mode. When second generation has appeared, the dominant wavelength is halved and the peak much weaker. This allows us to use secondary pattern is our analysis by setting their wavelength at half of the primary wavelength. Further generations do not seem to appear simultaneously and the peak is weak and broad. This could be a signature of a transition to chaos of a non-linear oscillator~\cite{Brau2011}.

\subsection*{Characteristic time measurement}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{growth}
	\caption{Growth of the instability. (a) Evolution of the gel velocity $v$ averaged over the whole surface. Inset: Evolution of the peak-to-peak amplitude $A(t)$ in semi logarithmic scale. The black line is the best exponential fit with $\tau=\SI{90}{\second}$. (b) Evolution of the bottom profile of the gel from onset of instability (yellow) to contact to both walls (brown). Note that the longitudinal size of the blister evolves in this regime. The thick black curve is the profile at much longer times and is at lower altitude due to swelling. Note that the blister foot, highlighted by the orange vertical line, has not moved since contact.}
	\label{fig:growth}
\end{figure}

In most of our samples it was possible to measure directly the peak-to-peak amplitude $A(t)$ from our confocal measurements. However when the wavelength is too large compared to the field of view, this approach breaks down since we cannot observe both the highest and lowest points of the surface. Even when valid, such a local measurement is rather noisy and we prefer to focus on the measure of the vertical velocity $v$ of the gel that can be integrated over the whole field of view.

We note that when both measurements were available (as in Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}a), the characteristic time $\tau$ obtained from the fit of the exponential growth of $A(t)$ was about $4A_\text{max}/v_\text{max}$, where $A_\text{max} = e-h$ is the amplitude when the gel comes in contact with both walls and $v_\text{max}$ is the maximum velocity of the gel. We used this approximation of $\tau$ for all our samples. This is consistent with the fact that the blister size ($\propto\lambda$) does not evolve after contact (see Fig.~\ref{fig:growth}b), thus the kinetic wavelength is set when $A(t) = A_\text{max}$.

\subsection*{Permeability measurements}
\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics{permeability}
	\caption{Permeability measurements. (a) Schematic representation of the experiment. (b-c) Evolution of the height of the interface in tube 1 relative to the final height in tube 2. The black line is the best exponential fit $Ae^{-t/\tau}$. (b) Gel is 4\%w casein, 4\%w GDL in water, $H=\SI{2.3}{\milli\metre}$ and $\tau=\SI{57}{\minute}$. (c) Same as (b) for a 50\%w glycerol--water mixture, $H=\SI{4}{\milli\metre}$ and $\tau=\SI{100}{\hour}$.}
	\label{fig:permeability}
\end{figure*}

To measure the permeability of our gels, we adapt a method from \cite{VanDijk1986}. First, the gel of interest is formed at the lower extremity of a thin glass tube. The tube is held vertical in a water saturated atmosphere to prevent evaporation until the pH has reached the isoelectric point ($\approx\SI{1}{\hour}$ for our most common composition). Then, we dip the tube in a bath of acetic acid/acetate buffer at pH=4. The buffer has the same glycerol content as the gel solvent, so that the viscosity is constant throughout the experiment. Alongside the first tube (see Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability} a), we dip a second identical tube with no gel in it. A webcam (Logitech Webcam Pro 9000) captures the rise of the liquid in each tube. Since the liquid height in tube 2 reaches its final value quickly, we measure directly $z_\infty-z(t)$.

Darcy law through the gel of permeability $\alpha$ and height $H$ reads 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\alpha}{\eta}\frac{\Delta P}{H}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta P=\rho g(z_\infty-z(t))$ is the hydrostatic pressure drop through the gel. We use tabulated values of water-glycerol mixtures for the density $\rho$ and viscosity $\eta$ of the buffer. We can thus write
\begin{equation}
\frac{d(z-z_\infty)}{dt} = -\frac{z-z_\infty}{\tau}\text{, with\,} \tau = \frac{\eta H}{\alpha \rho g}.
\end{equation}

By fitting $z(t)-z_\infty$ to an exponential (see Fig.~\ref{fig:permeability} b-c), we obtain $\tau$ and thus $\alpha$. Note that even with $H$ of the order of a few millimeters high glycerol contents yield $\tau\approx \SI{100}{\hour}$ due both to high viscosity and low permeability. Obtaining $z_\infty$ without tube 2 would be time prohibitive.

\subsection*{Supplementary movies}

\begin{description}
\item[Movie 1] Transmitted light microscopy images of the pattern formation in a 4\%w casein and 4\%w GDL aqueous dispersion. Top and bottom slides of the optical cell are coated with acrylamide brushes. The duration of the movie is 2~h~30. The scale bar is \SI{1}{\milli\metre}.

\item[Movie 2] 3D reconstruction of the pattern formation using confocal microscopy in a 4\%w casein and 4\%w GDL aqueous dispersion (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data}c). Top and bottom slides of the optical cell are coated with acrylamide brushes. The duration of the movie is2~h~30. The scale bar is \SI{1}{\milli\metre}.


\item[Movie 3] Titration of a dispersion with 1\%w casein by 1 molar HCl. The duration of the movie is \SI{13}{\minute}. The scale bar is XXX $\mu$m


\item[Movie 4] Titration of a dispersion with 4\%w casein by 1 molar HCl. The duration of the movie is \SI{14}{\minute}. The scale bar is XXX $\mu$m


\item[Movie 5] Confocal microscopy $(x,y)$ cut of the evolution of the local structure of a 4\%w casein and 4\%w GDL aqueous dispersion when sticky boundary are on. 1/10th of the proteins are fluorescently labelled. The duration of the movie is \SI{132}{\minute}. The scale bar is \SI{10}{\micro\metre}.

\item[Movie 6] Confocal microscopy $(x,y)$ cut of the evolution of the local structure of a 4\%w casein and 4\%w GDL aqueous dispersion when the top wall is coated with acrylamide brushes and the bottom wall remains sticky. 1/10th of the proteins are fluorescently labelled. The duration of the movie is \SI{147}{\minute}. The scale bar is \SI{10}{\micro\metre}.

\item[Movie 7] Confocal microscopy $(x,z)$ cut of the evolution of thegel sheet deflection of a 4\%w casein and 4\%w GDL aqueous dispersion when both top and bottom walls are coated with acrylamide brushes (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data}a). The scale bar is \SI{100}{\micro\metre} (with a pixel size ratio of 1.3). Here the gel starts close to the bottom wall, $H<H^*$. Darcy mechanism dominates the formation of the primary pattern. Total duration of the video is 145 min.

\item[Movie 8] Confocal microscopy $(x,z)$ cut of the evolution of the gel sheet deflection of a 4\%w casein and 4\%w GDL aqueous dispersion when both top and bottom walls are coated with acrylamide brushes (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:data}c). The scale bar is \SI{100}{\micro\metre} (with a pixel size ratio of 1.3). Here the gel starts far from either top or bottom wall, $H>H^*$. Poiseuille mechanism dominates the formation of the primary pattern. Total duration of the video is 181 min.
